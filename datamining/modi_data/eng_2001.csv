"Successful adults who were once adolescent underachievers   This retrospective study of professionally successful adults who were academic underachievers, during adolescence (N = 31) explored the phenomenological experience of underachievement, with particular focus on potentially interactive factors that might be associated with onset, maintenance, and reversal of underachievement. Underinvolved and nonencouraging parents and teachers, negative parental attitudes toward work, family conflict, lack of career direction, and family transitions were found to be associated with underachievement. Both the adolescents and their parents achieved in nonacademic areas. Findings suggest that personality factors, achiever role models outside of the family developmental task accomplishment, changes in location, and new academic courses may contribute to reversal of underachievement.",512.0,Successful adults who were once adolescent underachievers,2001.0
"An examination of Terman's gifted children from the theory of identity   Employing Erikson's identity theory within Marcia's operational framework, the association between identity formation and adult achievement was examined in a subset of gifted individuals from Terman's longitudinal study. Terman's most successful A group and the least successful C group were compared with respect to their identity formation. Significant relationships were found between identity formation and occupational success at the data points under study. The successful As were found to be mostly Identity Achievers, whereas the unsuccessful Cs were more likely Identity Diffusers. The explanation power of Erikson's identity theory for varied achievement in adulthood calls for attention to identity research in gifted education.",513.0,An examination of Terman's gifted children from the theory of identity,2001.0
"The relationship among giftedness, gender, and overexcitability   This study examines the relationship among giftednesss, gender, and overexcitability. Previous studies examining these relationships were based on an open-ended questionnaire and small samples. This study uses a new self-rating questionnaire to assess overexcitabilities, the Overexcitability Questionnaire II, and findings are based on a large sample of 562 university students. Gifted-ness was measured by a student's participation in either a gifted, advanced, or standard curriculum program. Results show that previous findings on the relationship between giftedness and overexcitability can be confirmed.; gifted students scored significantly higher on intellectual and emotional overexcitability than students in either of the other two programs. Further, males scored higher overall on intellectual, ima national, and psychomotor overexcitability, while females scored higher on emotional and sensual overexcitability.",514.0,"The relationship among giftedness, gender, and overexcitability",2001.0
"The influence of cooperative problem solving on gender differences in achievement, self-efficacy, and attitudes toward mathematics in gifted students   The purpose of this study was to investigate gender differences in self-efficacy, attitudes toward mathematics, and achievement of 48 gifted seventh- and eighth-grade students after participating in a two-week course on probability and statistics that was taught with a mathematical problem-solving approach using heuristic strategies. A pretest-posttest control group design was used, in which students were randomly assigned to one of two experimental groups or to a control group during a summer enrichment program offered to talented students. Although the literature suggests that cooperative learning settings, particularly single-gender groups, are more beneficial for females, no statistical differences in achievement or self-efficacy were found among the groups. Statistically significant differences in attitudes toward mathematics were found favoring students in the whole-group instruction, competitive setting.",515.0,"The influence of cooperative problem solving on gender differences in achievement, self-efficacy, and attitudes toward mathematics in gifted students",2001.0
"Gender differences in the motivation for and selection of courses in a summer program for academically talented students   In this study, we examined gender differences in course enrollment patterns, reasons for course choice, and enjoyment of course. Participants consisted of 804 academically talented students (433 females, 371 males) attending a summer program. Data were self-reported and were collected on a program evaluation questionnaire. Males enrolled in traditionally male (TM) courses in significantly greater numbers than they enrolled in traditionally female (TF) courses, but female enrollment in the two types of courses was more equal. Asian American students' course enrollment in TM and TF courses was more balanced than non-Asian American student enrollment, and Asian American students endorsed fewer internal reasons than non-Asian students did. Students in TM classes endorsed more external reasons for course choice than their colleagues in TF classes. Finally, students who gave more internal reasons for course choice reported enjoying classes more than students who gave more external reasons. No gender differences in motivation were found.",516.0,Gender differences in the motivation for and selection of courses in a summer program for academically talented students,2001.0

"If I had a new notebook, I know things would change: Bright underachieving young men in urban classrooms   Despite a preponderance of research on students who fail academically in urban schools, few studies have examined the academic experience of high-ability students in urban schools, particularly those who do not reach their potential The study described in this article examined what happens to intelligent urban teenagers when they achieve academically. Through a qualitative research design that integrated case study and ethnographic research, the investigation examined the lives of 6 high-ability males in an inner-city high school to understand how their urban life experiences influenced their underachievement. The 6 cases reported in this study are a subset of 12 cases (Hebert, 1993) that contributed to a larger study (Reis, Hebert, Diaz, Maxfield, & Ratley, 1995) of talented students an urban high school. Major findings uncovered in chronicling the lives of 6 underachievers included: inappropriate curricular and counseling experiences, problematic family issues, a negative peer group and environmental influences, and discipline problems. Implications of these findings are presented, as are suggestions meeting the educational needs of high-ability underachieving young men in urban secondary schools.",521.0,"If I had a new notebook, I know things would change: Bright underachieving young men in urban classrooms",2001.0
"Lessons from another field: Applying coteaching strategies to gifted education   Because research has found that differentiation of instructed for gifted students does not typically occur within the general classroom, collaboration between gifted and general education teachers is critical in order in order to ensure appropriate services to students with high abilities, Gifted education teachers are now being called upon to provide services to their students in the regular education environment. This fundamental change in setting mirrors mandated changes in special education, wherein students with disabilities are increasingly served in the general education classroom. This article provides a new definition of collaboration within the context of gifted education and expands on the utilization of coteaching ar a collaborative strategy. Five models pf coteaching originally developed for meeting the needs of students with disabilities were adapted and examples of their use with gifted students in the general education classroom are provided.",522.0,Lessons from another field: Applying coteaching strategies to gifted education,2001.0
"The processing of analogous problems in the verbal and visual-humorous (cartoons) modalities by gifted/average children   Children encounter problem solving in their formal schooling mainly in the verbal modality, whereas they are exposed to cartoons in their leisure time in a context perceived as nonlearning and nonthreatening. Yet, cartoons can be conceived of as problems in the visual-humorous modality, analogous to verbal problems. This article examines how gifted and average children solve analogous problems in these two modalities (verbal and visual), including their ability to consciously transfer solutions from one modality to the other. Specifically, four variables are considered: (1) the correctness solutions of analogous problems in both modalities; (2) the students' perceived difficulty of these problems; (3) their awareness of the correctness of their solutions; and (4) their awareness of the contribution of a learned source problem in one modality to the solution of an analogous Ir problem in the other. Gifted children, as expected, better on the verbal problems, but improved their skills in both modalities once exposed to the solution of analogous problems in the visual-humorous modality. Average children tended to solve cartoons better than verbal. problems, but working with cartoons increased their verbal problem-solving skills. Results suggest that cartoon solving in the classroom can enhance the problem-solving capabilities of both populations.",523.0,The processing of analogous problems in the verbal and visual-humorous (cartoons) modalities by gifted/average children,2001.0
"Goals, attention, and video game performance among gifted children   Gifted children's goals for learning on their video game performance and patterns of attention were examined. Before playing a game, second- and fifth-graders were instructed to adopt an evaluative, process, outcome, or no specific goal focus while playing. Children were then asked about the game strategies and game features they attended to while playing. Older children showed better performance overall and their best performance when instructed to adopt an evaluative goal. Younger children showed their worst performance in the same condition. This developmental pattern of findings was reversed among children instructed to adopt an outcome goal. Postgame responses indicated developmental differences in game features, strategies, and evaluation assessments. Most children across both grades made reference to process goals. These findings provide preliminary support for the hypothesis that gifted children's goals for learning impact their performance and attention and that this impact may be influenced by their developmental level.",524.0,"Goals, attention, and video game performance among gifted children",2001.0

"Jermaine: A critical case study of a gifted black child living in rural poverty   Gifted students exist in the culture of rural poverty; however, these children often are not identified, and schools fail to provide appropriate educational programs, preventing young people from realizing their potential. In this account of a gifted Black child living in an impoverished rural environment, a university researcher and a classroom teacher collaborated in order to describe a young man's creativity, his resilience, and the significant factors that influenced the early formation of a strong self-identity. The findings of the study offer educators helpful suggestions for identifying and addressing the educational needs of gifted Black children living in rural poverty.",529.0,Jermaine: A critical case study of a gifted black child living in rural poverty,2001.0
"Identifying artistically talented students in four rural communities in the United States   Project ARTS was designed as a research and development project to identify high-ability, artistically talented third graders from four different ethnic backgrounds in seven rural schools and to implement differentiated arts programs for them. Locally designed identification measures, developed by teachers and community members, were found to be appropriate by teachers and staff if several different measures were used. In research about identification of students for Project ARTS, scores on the Torrance Tests of Creativity, Clark's Drawing Abilities Test, and state achievement tests were found to be correlated. Except at one site, gender was not found to be a significant variable on these tests. It was recommended that local measures, the CDAT, and achievement tests be used to identify artistically talented students in rural communities with populations similar to those in Project ARTS.",530.0,Identifying artistically talented students in four rural communities in the United States,2001.0
"Gifted students' perceptions of their class activities: Differences among rural, urban, and suburban student attitudes   The purpose of this study was to investigate differences in attitudes toward classroom activities among rural, urban, and suburban gifted students. More specifically, the instrument My Class Activities, designed to assess students' attitudes toward their class activities with respect to Interest, Challenge, Choice, and Enjoyment, was used to show how gifted students from rural schools differed from their counterparts in urban and suburban schools. Rural elementary students found their classrooms less frequently enjoyable than their urban and suburban peers. Rural middle school students reported less challenge and less enjoyment than their suburban peers. Implications of the findings for gifted students in rural settings are discussed and suggestions for addressing these dimensions for gifted students in rural areas provided. Additionally, validity and reliability evidence is provided for My Class Activities.",531.0,"Gifted students' perceptions of their class activities: Differences among rural, urban, and suburban student attitudes",2001.0
"DISCOVER: Concurrent validity, gender differences, and identification of minority students   This study used the Raven Progressive Matrices to examine the concurrent validity of the DISCOVER assessment. It also investigated gender differences. A secondary purpose was to determine the effectiveness of the DISCOVER assessment in reducing the problem of minority students being under-represented in programs for the gifted. The sample consisted of 257 kindergarten, second, fourth, and fifth graders, predominantly Navajo Indians and Mexican Americans. The results provided some evidence for concurrent validity and showed that, through the use of the DISCOVER assessment, 22.9% of minority students were identified as gifted. A MANOVA (gender by grade level) resulted in the absence of significant main effects for both gender and grade, as well as for gender by grade interaction. Chi-square tests revealed no overall significant promote the use of the DISCOVER assessment for identification purposes.",532.0,"DISCOVER: Concurrent validity, gender differences, and identification of minority students",2001.0
"An evaluation of the catalyst program: Consultation and collaboration in gifted education   A recent evaluation of the Catalyst Program, a resource consultation and collaboration program in gifted education, was conducted in order to investigate the effects of student academic performance and teacher competencies, as well as the effectiveness of the consulting process applied to gifted education. In a two-year pilot program, general educators and gifted education specialist at 10 elementary schools in a large, urban school district consulted and collaborated with one another to provide differentiated educational experiences to gifted learners. Results indicate that the model was an effective service delivery strategy for providing differentiated education to gifted learners, had positive spill-over effects for the entire school, led to a redefined role of the gifted education specialist, and initiated an articulation of the nature of the consulting process when applied to gifted education.",533.0,An evaluation of the catalyst program: Consultation and collaboration in gifted education,2001.0

"Measuring the outcomes of state policies for gifted education: An equity analysis of Texas school districts   Policy research in gifted education continues to maintain a relatively narrow focus, dealing primarily with policy inputs like the presence and design of written mandates or the existence or lack of state funding. yet, little attention has been paid to the actual distribution of programming opportunities for gifted children. There continues to be a vast disconnect between policy analysts and gifted educators. The objective of this article is to help bridge that gap by (1) intoducing a set of policy tools for measuring the outcomes of gifted education policies and (2) applying those tools to data on the distribution of gifted education spending and designated personnel in the state of Texas. According to generally accepted policy benchmarks, the analyses performed indicate (a) continued vast inequities across school districts in the availability of resources and (b) unacceptable correlations between student population characteristics, community wealth, and the availability of opportunity.",537.0,Measuring the outcomes of state policies for gifted education: An equity analysis of Texas school districts,2001.0
"Heterogeneity within the gifted: Higher IQ boys exhibit behaviors resembling boys with learning disabilities   Previous studies of the gifted have been inconsistent, portraying them as both more and less well adjusted than the nongifted or less gifted. We examined behavioral, cognitive, attentional, and family history dimensions among four groups of 87 boys: High Gifted (IQ 140-154), Low Gifted (IQ 124-139), Learning Disabled, and a Normal control group. Findings indicated that High Gifted boys exhibit levels of behavior problems similar to the Learning Disabled, whereas Low Gifted boys demonstrate significantly lower levels of behavioral problems than do the Learning Disabled boys. These data provide support for the view of the gifted population as heterogeneous, with the High Gifted exhibiting more behavioral problems than the Low Gifted.",538.0,Heterogeneity within the gifted: Higher IQ boys exhibit behaviors resembling boys with learning disabilities,2001.0

"Learning styles of gifted and nongifted secondary students in Hong Kong   The learning activities and learning styles of 398 gifted and nongifted Chinese secondary students were assessed using the Chinese version of the Learning Styles Inventory (Renzulli & Smith, 1978; Renzulli, Smith & Rizza, 1998). Dimensions of preferred learning activities common for gifted and nongifted students included factors interpretable as learning through verbal interaction, learning by role-play, and learning by doing. Comparing gifted and nongifted students, gifted students indicated significantly greater preferences for learning styles related to interpersonal verbal exchanges and autonomous learning. Although there were no significant gender differences in learning style preferences, the younger age group indicated significantly greater preference for learning styles related to structured activities and games than the older age group.

Comparing and contrasting: Stories of competition   Competition plays an important role in the lives of gifted adolescents. Some research suggests that schools encourage competition simply by the nature of assigning grades and that students learn very early about the winners and losers. This study investigated how a group of 11 successful high school female students described the impact of competition on their academic and social lives. Qualitative methodology was used to identify themes that described how the participants maintained a competitive profile while still sustaining social contacts and friendships. Competition was viewed by participants as a negative behavior and comparing was a preferred word to describe their own competitive actions.,542.0,Comparing and contrasting: Stories of competition,2001.0
