"5 YEARS OF EARLY ENTRANTS - PREDICTING SUCCESSFUL ACHIEVEMENT IN COLLEGE   This study evaluated the achievements of 65 young entrants as beginning undergraduates in a highly selective university. The group as a whole was found to be quite successful. Compared to nonaccelerants, the early entrants tended to graduate in a shorter period of time and earn more honors at graduation. For the early entrants, starting college with a large number of Advanced Placement Program credits was found to be the best predictor of outstanding academic achievement. It seems advisable for young college entrants to have Scholastic Aptitude Test scores and content knowledge equal to or greater than that of the typical freshman at the college the student will attend.",898.0,5 YEARS OF EARLY ENTRANTS - PREDICTING SUCCESSFUL ACHIEVEMENT IN COLLEGE,1990.0
"IDENTIFYING GIFTED AND TALENTED STUDENTS IN AN ALTERNATIVE LEARNING-CENTER   This study determined the percentage of students enrolled in a high school alternative learning center who were potentially gifted and talented. Alternative learning centers are designed for disruptive, disaffected youth who cannot or will not function in the regular high school setting. Scores in the top 5 % on the Otis-Lennon School Ability Test and/or the IBRIC Biographical Inventory academic, creative, artistic, and leadership sub-tests, as well as nominations by teachers and peers were used to identify potentially gifted and talented students from among 93 11th and 12th grade alternative learning center students.

"IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION OF MATHEMATICALLY GIFTED STUDENTS - A REVIEW OF EMPIRICAL-RESEARCH   This paper summarizes and critiques the empirical research of the 1970s and 80s on identification processes and descriptions of mathematically gifted students. Most research centered on precocious students who score well on tests. Largely overlooked are other gifted students with potential in mathematics. We suggest that future research focus on the identification of these students and on the contributions of home environments and spatial abilities, problem-solving strategies, and attributions for success of all G/T students in whatever manner they are defined.",900.0,IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION OF MATHEMATICALLY GIFTED STUDENTS - A REVIEW OF EMPIRICAL-RESEARCH,1990.0
"HIGH ABILITY STUDENTS WHO ARE UNPOPULAR WITH THEIR PEERS   Although previous studies have found that high ability students generally enjoy favorable peer status, few studies have investigated those high ability students who are unpopular even with peers of comparable ability. The present study compared unpopular high ability students with average and popular groups on measures of achievement, family social status, and personality adjustment. Results indicate relatively few differences between average and popular students, but unpopular students are distinguished by lower social self-concept and academic self-esteem, as well as by less prestigious paternal occupations. There was no evidence that unpopular students were academically less capable, less mature, or more anxious than their more popular peers.",901.0,HIGH ABILITY STUDENTS WHO ARE UNPOPULAR WITH THEIR PEERS,1990.0
"POSTPOSITIVIST INQUIRY - IMPLICATIONS OF THE NEW PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE FOR THE FIELD OF THE EDUCATION OF THE GIFTED   In this paper I sketch the outlines of an emerging postpositivist paradigm for inquiry and research. This new paradigm is the product of recent thinking in philosophy, the natural sciences, and the social sciences—the so-called ""new philosophy of science"" (Phillips, 1987)— and has been embraced primarily, but not exclusively, by investigators using qualitative methods. Drawing heavily upon the work of Lincoln and Guba (Lincoln & Guba, 1985; Guba & Lincoln, 1989), I delineate the axioms (basic beliefs) underlying this approach and then consider the methodological implications that follow logically from the axioms. Finally, I suggest some applications of postpositivist inquiry in the field of the education of the gifted.",902.0,POSTPOSITIVIST INQUIRY - IMPLICATIONS OF THE NEW PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE FOR THE FIELD OF THE EDUCATION OF THE GIFTED,1990.0

"THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF PROGRAMS FOR THE DISADVANTAGED GIFTED IN THE UNITED-STATES AND TERRITORIES   This article reports results of a study designed to assess the nature and extent of programs for disadvantaged gifted learners in the 50 states and the United States' territories. The primary purposes of the study were: 1) to determine the philosophical and definitional considerations utilized by states in addressing issues related to the disadvantaged gifted, 2) to ascertain the major approaches to identification and program interventions utilized with these populations, and 3) to determine the level and extent of state funding patterns, policies, procedures, and program standards. The findings indicated that although states have been consistently positive in their philosophical orientation toward culturally diverse and low socioeconomic gifted students, they have lagged behind in incorporating these concerns for equity and pluralism into the definitional and funding structures of their gifted programs.",909.0,THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF PROGRAMS FOR THE DISADVANTAGED GIFTED IN THE UNITED-STATES AND TERRITORIES,1990.0
"PREDICTORS OF PERFORMANCE OF DISADVANTAGED ADOLESCENTS IN A GIFTED PROGRAM   This study investigated the relative value of different measures in selecting disadvantaged South Africans for an enrichment program. Results on the measures for 99 13-18-year-old students were intercorrelated with achievement in the Soweto Gifted Child Program (SGCP). Regression analyses indicated that 50-58% of the variance in performance in the SGCP was accounted for by several significant predictors; namely, two subtests (the Verbal Analogies Test and the Organiser) of the Learning Potential Assessment Device, school performance, and the combined Similarities subtests of the WAIS-R and WISC-R.

"THE RACE IS NOT NECESSARILY TO THE SWIFT - VALIDITY OF WISC-R BONUS POINTS FOR SPEED   To investigate speed as a factor in WISC-R performance, scores of 66 high-scoring (IQ 120 + ) and 36 average-scoring (IQ < 120) children were examined in a clinic for gifted children. Although significant mean group differences were found on all subtests, they were only marginal for Coding, which depends strongly on speed. On the three subtests using speed bonus points, the high-scoring group gave more correct answers, but on only one, Block Design, was there a trend toward more bonus points for speed. The results are interpreted as casting serious doubt on the utility of speed bonuses in tests of general intelligence with gifted children.",912.0,THE RACE IS NOT NECESSARILY TO THE SWIFT - VALIDITY OF WISC-R BONUS POINTS FOR SPEED,1990.0

Both groups completed a sociometric nomination instrument in which they rated classmates. Results were analyzed in terms of the percentage of students assigned to popular, rejected, or neglected categories by peers. A 2 (gifted) x 2 (gender) analysis was used. Gifted boys were most popular while gifted girls were least popular.

"AN ANALYSIS OF THE MOST FREQUENTLY CITED GIFTED JOURNAL ARTICLES SINCE THE MARLAND REPORT - IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCHERS   Over 500 separate journal articles were reviewed to identify the 25 most frequently cited articles between 1972, the year the Marland Report was published, and 1988. To qualify for the data base the article must have used the term ""gifted"" or some related term (e.g., ""giftedness,"" ""genius,"" ""precocious"") in the title or have been indexed by ERIC or Psychological Abstracts with that term as a descriptor. The 25 most frequently cited articles were compared to a random sample of 25 articles from the same data set on a number of characteristics (e.g., purpose, theoretical basis, topical area, research design, and statistical methods). In general, comparisons on these and other variables showed few differences between frequently cited and randomly chosen articles. In comparison to other psychological/ educational disciplines gifted articles were cited much less frequently and used less sophisticated research designs and statistical analyses. Furthermore, articles tended to lack either a theoretical or research basis. Implications of these findings for the discipline are discussed.",914.0,AN ANALYSIS OF THE MOST FREQUENTLY CITED GIFTED JOURNAL ARTICLES SINCE THE MARLAND REPORT - IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCHERS,1990.0

"SOURCES OF GIFTEDNESS IN NATURE AND NURTURE - HISTORICAL ORIGINS OF ENDURING CONTROVERSIES   Theories of evolution inspired nineteenth-century scientists to investigate the effects of physical and mental traits upon heredity. The controversies that arose are divisible into two consecutive periods. The ""onset"" period , which spans the years of the late nineteenth century, centers on the contributions of Charles Darwin, FrancesGalton, and Karl Pearson. During this time, the promise of selective breeding led to the founding of the eugenics movement. The ""flowering"" period, which en compasses the early years of the twentieth century, deals mainly with Lewis M. Terman's attempts to resolve nature-nurture disputes associated with intellect and gift edness. The commentary covers events that led to the 1928 yearbook, Nature and Nurture.

"ASPECTS OF PERSONALITY AND PEER RELATIONS OF EXTREMELY TALENTED ADOLESCENTS   Exceptionally gifted students may be at risk for problems in social and emotional development. To discover if peer relations are affected by type and/or amount of giftedness, extremely mathematically or verbally talented 13 year-olds (top 1 in 10,000) were compared to modestly gifted students (top 1 in 20) of similar age on measures of popularity and peer acceptance, participation in group activities, and personality traits. The verbatly or mathematically talented students were also contrasted on the same measures. Virtually no differences in group activities or personality traits were found. In their ratings of peer perceptions, the modestly gifted group exceeded the extremely gifted, especially the verbally gifted, in being considered athletic and popular, and in social standing. The modestly gifted also rated themselves as more extroverted, socially adept, and uninhibited. Perceptions of peer ratings of importance and acceptance were higher for the mathematically than the verbally gifted. Thus, extremely precocious adolescents, especially the verbally precocious, may be at greater risk for developing problems in peer relations than modestly gifted youth.",930.0,ASPECTS OF PERSONALITY AND PEER RELATIONS OF EXTREMELY TALENTED ADOLESCENTS,1990.0

Such students differ cognitively. Verbally precocious students scored higher on verbal and gerieral knowledge types of tests, and mathematically precocious students scored higher on tests of nonverbal reasoning, spatial ability, and memory. Results from the factor analysis of test scores (excluding memory test scores) yielded three factors: spatial/speed, verbal, and nonverbal. Mathematically talented students had higher scores on the nonverbal and speed factors; verbally talented students had higher scores on the verbal factor. Thus, at least two distinct forms of giftedness seem to exist (i.e., verbal and nonverbal).
