"An investigation of the effects of total school flexible cluster grouping on identification, achievement, and classroom practices   This paper presents the findings of a longitudinal, causal comparative investigation of an elementary school cluster; grouping program. Both quantitative and qualitative methodologies were used. Although the cluster grouping program was originally designed to preside differentiation of content and instruction for gifted students, Fosiive effects were also found on the achievement of all students in the school. During the three program years, students involved in the school using cluster grouping were more likely to be identified as high achieving or above average. Fewer students were identified as low achieving. A significant increase in achievement test scores of all students was found when these students were compared to similar students from a comparison school district. Qualitative analyses yielded three core cate- gories-the use of grouping, the impact of teachers, and the general school environment-that helped to provide an understanding of the quantitative findings.",575.0,"An investigation of the effects of total school flexible cluster grouping on identification, achievement, and classroom practices",1999.0
"DISCOVER: A promising alternative assessment for the identification of gifted minorities   Based on the general framework of Gardner's (1983) theory of multiple intelligences and Maker's (1996) definition of giftedness, the DISCOVER process is a performance-based assessment designed to identify gifted students from culturally diverse groups. The process consists of five activities through which linguistic, logical-mathematical, and spatial intelligences are appraised. In this review, I describe the assessment and review preliminary studies on its reliability and validity. The DISCOVER assessment seems to be a promising alternative technique through which the problem of underrepresentation of gifted minorities in programs for the gifted I might be reduced. However, educators using the DISCOVER assessment for identification purposes must make sure that a good match exists between the assessment and the type of gifted program in which students will be placed.",576.0,DISCOVER: A promising alternative assessment for the identification of gifted minorities,1999.0
"Comparison of traditional and problem solving assessment criteria   Identifying students who are gifted has been grounded traditionally in criteria emphasizing unitary measures of intellectual ability, which has caused great concern for educators interested in identifying academic talent and potential in culturally and linguistically diverse students. Recently, multiple intelligences (MI) theory has been examined as an alternative perspective with promise for addressing concerns evident in groups identified using traditional methods. To date, research on the effectiveness of assessment practices grounded in MI theory has been sparse. The purpose of this research was to describe the performance of elementary school children on an alternative screening measure designed for use in identifying students who are gifted. The Problem Solving Assessment procedure represented an application of MI theory, and decisions made using it were compared to those that would be made using a more traditional, unitary approach to identification. Positive relations were evident among scores for different types of intelligences and between them and the traditional measure. More importantly, different groups of students were identified using each approach, with a more diverse population generated with the Problem Solving Assessment procedure. The results are discussed with regard to ongoing practices and future directions in gifted education.",577.0,Comparison of traditional and problem solving assessment criteria,1999.0
"Elementary student talent searches: Establishing appropriate guidelines for qualifying test scores   Traditionally talent searches administer college entrance examinations to seventh and eighth graders who score in the top 3-5% on in-grade achievement tests. Research dating back to the 1970s indicates that talent searches effectively provide a specific assessment of ability level in these gifted students. More recently, the talent search model has been. applied to third- through sixth-grade gifted students. The Elementary Student Talent Search, for example, uses EXPLORE (a test designed for eighth graders) as an above-level test. Very little research has been conducted on the talent search model as applied to elementary students, however. Our data indicate that talent participants earn EXPLORE scores that:are approximately normally distributed and that they:compare: favourably to eighth-grade norms. EXPLORE scores below chance level are rare. Raising the requirements :for Talent Search eligibility would increase the number of false negatives more than it would decrease false positives.",578.0,Elementary student talent searches: Establishing appropriate guidelines for qualifying test scores,1999.0

"To thine own self be true: A new model of female talent development   The article describes an innovative model of female talent development based upon the life experiences of gifted women from a wide variety of backgrounds and talent domains. The model was synthesised from original studies contributed by more that 20 scholars, psychologists, and educators, known collectively as Remarkable women: Perspectives on Female Talent Development (Arnold, Noble, & Subotnik, 1996). Key issues addressed by this model are the personal, professional, and cultural challenges common to gifted females as well as strategies for coping with them, spheres of influence and achievement to which gifted women aspire, and ways to help gifted women and girls identify and actualise their talents and gifts.",582.0,To thine own self be true: A new model of female talent development,1999.0
"The lifelong productivity of the female researchers in Terman's genetic studies of genius longitudinal study   An analysis of information collected from historical archives reveal a wealth of data on 30 female researchers who worked in various capacities with Dr. Lewis Terman in conducting his classic longitudinal study, Genetic Studies of Genius (1925), on 1,528 gifted children in California. The published and unpublished papers, memoranda, and research field notes of these researchers, their respective correspondence with Terman and each other, and some contacts with a living member of the research team and family members were used for this analysis. Although the information is incomplete on some of the women, most of them appeared to have had satisfying personal lives in addition to productive professional careers. Not only did they each contribute greatly to the actual work of carrying out Terman's research conception, they also represent a continium of life-long productivity. Personal responsibilities may have had more to do with their subsequent levels of productivity than societal expectations or conventions.",583.0,The lifelong productivity of the female researchers in Terman's genetic studies of genius longitudinal study,1999.0
"The optimal context for gifted students: A preliminary exploration of motivational and affective considerations   This study was designed to verify the efficacy of a conceptual model intended to be used to examine the relative effectiveness of a variety of educational interventions in terms of the self-reported satisfaction of gifted students affective and motivational needs. The participants in this stage of the study were 540 Year & students comprising 402 gifted students grouped in selective high schools, 76 gifted students grouped in accelerated cohorts, and a mixed ability group of 62 students. The preliminary analysis of self-reports from the total population of students who participated in the first stage of this study, including principal component analysis and multiple regression analyses, supports the social-constructivist conceptual framework proposed. The hypothesized positive correlation between the Quality of School Life variables and Intrinsic Motivation was confirmed. The positive correlations between the Anxiety and Tedium variables and the corresponding negative correlation with Quality of School Life variables lent support for the theoretical rationale underpinning the inclusion of measures of boredom.",584.0,The optimal context for gifted students: A preliminary exploration of motivational and affective considerations,1999.0
"The independence of creative potential and behavior disorders in gifted children   Samples of gifted children in Louisiana (N = 44) and Connecticut (N = 34) were administered the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking (TTCT), and their parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). As predicted scores on the TTCT and CBCL were statistically unrelated. Also as predicted, scores for the CBCL were very similar to national norms (Achenbach, 1991) and represented an absence of behavior disorders. Contrary to expectations, TTCT scores were slightly below national norms (Torrance, 1990c). Previous research has demonstrated a relationship between creativity that this relationship is a result of selection on the basis of artistic eminence rather than superior intellectual functioning.",585.0,The independence of creative potential and behavior disorders in gifted children,1999.0
"Developing leadership skills of pre-adolescent gifted learners in small group settings   This study is the result of a partnership of teachers and researchers exploring the leadership behavior of gifted learners working in small groups. Using videotape analysis and a model of transformational leadership, this study traced a process for diagnosing the leadership needs of gifted learners and created instructional interventions to enable students to transfer skills developed in a teacher-directed lesson to other setting. Transformational leadership is a viable model for conceptualizing leadership of gifted learners, although the frequency of leadership behavior was relatively small.",586.0,Developing leadership skills of pre-adolescent gifted learners in small group settings,1999.0

"The effects of mentoring relationships on preservice teachers' attitudes toward academically diverse students   Preservice teachers from seven universities were studied as part of a three-year project focusing on how preservice teachers develop an awareness of the needs of academically diverse learners and then implement or modify instruction to meet those needs. The research reported here describes the impact of the study's interventions on preservice teachers attitudes, beliefs, and practices as they relate to academically diverse learners. All participants completed a survey designed to assess their attitudes, beliefs, and practices regarding struggling and gifted learners prior to and upon completion of the interventions. Using a univariate repeated analysis of variance technique statistically significant differences were found between the two intervention groups attitudes toward differentiation. Results suggest that is novices become more acquainted with the realities of the classroom, they gain a clear picture of the complexity involved in appropriate curriculum modifications to address the academic needs of diverse learners.",589.0,The effects of mentoring relationships on preservice teachers' attitudes toward academically diverse students,1999.0
"Integrating gifted children into kindergarten by improving educational processes   At the beginning of kindergarten, it often happens that a gifted child is not doing well because he or she may be forced to underachieve. A longitudinal case study clarifies this process. The analysis and discussion of the problems reveal clues for prevention in kindergarten and subsequent forms of education. Each child entering kindergarten could be included in a screening procedure in which parents of the child. Relevant differences in development between students could be basic to part of the pedagogical, play, and didactic characteristics provided for in kindergarten. The curricular and instructional aspects of this student-based instruction effect changes in teachers' pedagogical focus and helps them in realizing challenging adjustments in the play and learning activities offered. Two cases in which suggested strategies are utilized illustrate what this means for gifted children and their teachers. Positive effects may become greatest for students whose level of development is either clearly higher or lower than that of their age mates in one or more aspects.",590.0,Integrating gifted children into kindergarten by improving educational processes,1999.0
"The crystallizing experience: A study in musical precocity   This study examines the nature of musical precocity and the mechanisms that mediate a crystallizing experience. Howard Gardner (1993) has made a cogent argument for the inclusion of musical intelligence in the spectrum of human intelligences. He has proposed that this musical ability may evolve in different ways. One of these is the crystallizing experience, a dramatic event in a person's life that makes manifest inherent giftedness. The crystallizing experience may serve as useful construct for explaining how certain talented individuals first commit themselves to an area of giftedness. The present study involved 24 musically precocious boys of middle school age who were asked questions, individually and in focus groups, regarding the nature of crystallizing experiences. This study of the crystallizing experience revealed important implications for understanding the structure and composition of extraordinary performance.",591.0,The crystallizing experience: A study in musical precocity,1999.0
"Parents' reports on homework amount and problems in academically talented elementary students   This study examined the amount and types of responses to homework assignments reported by parents of academically talented elementary students. Participants consisted of parents of 477 students in kindergarten through grade 6 who attended a summer program for the academically talented. Using a modified version of the Homework Problem Checklist (Anesko, Schofock, Ramirez, & Levine, 1987), parents provided information on students' responses to completing homework, the amount of homework given in school, and the amount of time spent assisting with homework. Parents also gave an estimate of the amount of homework that should be assigned in a summer academic program. Results indicated that academically talented students completed homework with few negative responses and most parents indicated that homework should be given during an academic summer program. Whereas amount of homework assigned in school and amount of proposed summer homework increased with grade level, the amount of time parents spent assisting with homework did not increase beyond first grade.",592.0,Parents' reports on homework amount and problems in academically talented elementary students,1999.0
"The effect of relocation on gifted students   Over the course of two years, researchers conducted two qualitative studies to investigate the impact of moving on gifted children. Participants were five families, each of which included gifted children and at least one parent presently or recently in the military. Study 1 involved elementary students living on a military base, and students in Study 2 attended suburban high schools. While academic performance was not hindered by moving, parents and students reported that organizational inconsistencies among schools (e.g., widely varying criteria for admittance to gifted programs) were a frequent cause of frustration. Frequent relocations had little impact on parent and student perceptions of the gifted children's long-term social, emotional, and academic development. In the short term, however, certain children experienced varying degrees of social difficulties that appeared to result from the relocations.",593.0,The effect of relocation on gifted students,1999.0

"Theories and the good: Toward child-centered gifted education   Educators tend to look to theories for ideas on how to educate Gifted children. Theories are, however, not value-neutral explanations, but complex attempts to serve human goals that contain values and ideas for action, as well as explanations. When there is a disjunction between a theory and ideas about what is good for gifted children, the latter should he our guide. The most important value in gifted education, we argue, should be child-centeredness. Theories can serve this value by helping us to understand the perspective of a gifted child. Most models and theories (Maslow's and Dabrowski's being the primary exceptions) address the conditions that promote gifted achievement and do not illuminate the inner life of gifted children. And yet, the pressure to achieve often has negative consequences for the emotional well-being of the child. Roeper's education for self-actualization and interdependence offers an approach to gifted education that respects the inner life of gifted children and assists them in finding their own way in life.",596.0,Theories and the good: Toward child-centered gifted education,1999.0
"Leadership giftedness: Models revisited   Following a review of adult models of leadership and of leadership programs for young people that are derived from adult theories of leadership, we report results from a decade-long study in underserved and at-risk communities of young people identified and promoted as leaders within out-of-school youth organizations. This work reveals how emerging youth leadership differs from established measures and leadership theories drawn from adults. Views and enactments of leadership among the young focus on how leadership happens, not on who leaders are as power figures, skillful managers, or individuals bearing specific traits. These perspectives from youth carry strong links to recent work in cognitive psychology and organizational sociology that maintains the key importance of adaptation, engagement with situation, and distribution of knowledge and roles.",597.0,Leadership giftedness: Models revisited,1999.0
"The psychological essence of the child prodigy phenomenon: Sensitive periods and cognitive experience   The article presents a new approach to the understanding of the child prodigy phenomenon. According to this approach, the prodigy phenomenon is a result of the extremely accelerated mental development during sensitive periods that leads to the rapid growth of a child's cognitive resources and their construction into specific cognitive experience. The latter is the psychological basis of extraordinary intellectual creative achievements and expresses itself in the prodigy's unique intellectual picture of the world. The psychological nature of the prodigy phenomenon is therefore formed by sensitive periods that should be viewed as its fundamental mechanism and by cognitive experience. This approach explains both the process of the prodigy phenomenon (i.e., prodigious development) and its product (i.e., prodigies' exceptional performance and achievements).",598.0,The psychological essence of the child prodigy phenomenon: Sensitive periods and cognitive experience,1999.0
