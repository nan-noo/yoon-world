Gifted children with Asperger's syndrome   Asperger's Syndrome is a pervasive developmental disorder characterized by deficits in social communication and by repetitive patterns of behaviors or interests. It is observed in some gifted children. The author proposes that gifted children with Asperger's Syndrome may not be identified because their unusual behaviors may be wrongly attributed to either their giftedness or to a learning disability. The article discusses ways in which Asperger's Syndrome might be missed in gifted children and proposes guidelines for differentiating characteristics of giftedness from characteristics of Asperger's Syndrome.,546.0,Gifted children with Asperger's syndrome,2000.0
"Gifted and gay: A study of the adolescent experience   A retrospective study of the adolescent experience of 18 gay, lesbian, or bisexual young adults with high ability (12 males, 6 females) using a postpositivistic mode of inquiry found significant themes of danger, isolation, depression and suicidal ideation, together with high achievement and extreme involvement in activities, in their narrative responses to an extended questionnaire. Participants described personal responses to wondering about sexual orientation, being convinced , and eventually coming out, and the effects on school and family relationships. Half reported awareness by the end of elementary school, and almost all were convinced by grade 11. Most participants offered suggestions for educators in general and for those involved in gifted programs, and many of the suggestions have implications for staff development.",547.0,Gifted and gay: A study of the adolescent experience,2000.0
"Dissociation and integration of talent development and personal growth: Comments and suggestions   This article is a response to Grant and Piechoswki's (1999) article regarding the tension between two aspects of gifted education: talent development and personal growth. We believe that dissociation of these two aspects is conditional, not a constant state of affairs. We identify those contingencies and processes that are responsible for the dissociation. We also believe that integration of these two perspectives is not only possible, but crucial for the well-rounded development of persons who have been the targeted populations of special services for the gifted and talented. One way to achieve this integration is to reconceptualize talent, achievement/success, and productivity in a way that illuminates the intrinsic connections between talent development and personal growth.",548.0,Dissociation and integration of talent development and personal growth: Comments and suggestions,2000.0
"Wisdom as a form of giftedness   This article describes an important, yet largely neglected, kind of giftedness, namely, wisdom. First, the article discusses how giftedness is identified currently. Second, the article presents an alternative view based on a balance theory of wisdom. The theory is described, and it is shown why the theory offers a useful way of conceptualizing wisdom. Finally, the article concludes that, given the state of the world, we should have a strong incentive to identify and develop wisdom as a form of giftedness.",549.0,Wisdom as a form of giftedness,2000.0
"Gifted dropouts: The who and the why   Two studies were conducted to obtain comprehensive information about gifted high school dropouts and to examine factors that are related to their dropout behavior using the Dropout and Student questionnaires of the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88). The results indicted that many gifted dropouts were from low socioeconomic-status families and racial minority groups; had parents with low levels of education; and participated less in extracurricular activities. Also, reasons for gifted male dropouts were more related to economic issues, while reasons for gifted female dropouts were more related to personal issues, although both males and females were likely to offer school-related reasons. The logistic regression analysis results indicated that dropout behavior for gifted students was significantly related to students' educational aspirations, pregnancy or child-rearing, gender, father's highest level of education, and mother's highest level of education.",550.0,Gifted dropouts: The who and the why,2000.0

"The underachievement of gifted students: What do we know and where do we go?   The process of defining underachievement, identifying underachieving gifted students, and explaining the reasons for this underachievement continues to stir controversy among practitioners, researchers, and clinicians. Despite this interest, the underachievement of gifted students remains an enigma. This article reviews and analysis three decades of research on the underachievement of gifted students in an attempt to clarify the present state of research. The problems inherent in defining and identifying underachieving gifted students are given special attention. The authors also include suggestions for those interested in pursuing potentially promising new lines of research and inquiry in this area.",553.0,The underachievement of gifted students: What do we know and where do we go?,2000.0
"Scrutinizing common sense: The role of practical intelligence in intellectual giftedness   Predicted on Sternberg's conception of practical intelligence, this study examined the practical abilities of intellectually gifted adolescents in order to investigate the extent practical abilities relate to academic abilities . Two questionnaires were administered to 296 gifted and mainstream eight graders from Singapore. Clinical interviews provided insights into students' tacit understanding of self so as to shed some light on practical abilities that may underlie broad notions of success. Results indicated a marginal association between practical and academic a marginal association between practical and academic abilities and suggest that academically gifted children are no different from mainstream children in the solution of practical problems. regardless of academic ability, children high in practical intelligence displayed a height-ended sense of self and a keener awareness of the hidden curriculum, school smartness, and successful adaptation to environments, true common sense must point toward a need to help children reach for a gestalt in making meaning of their lives.",554.0,Scrutinizing common sense: The role of practical intelligence in intellectual giftedness,2000.0
"Temperament-based learning styles of identified gifted and nongifted students   Learning style preferences of 1,554 students identified as gifted and nongifted students, ages 8 to 17, were measured using the Student Styles Questionnaire (SSQ). Students identified as gifted and nongifted students did not differ significantly on extroverted-introverted, organized-flexible, and thinking-feeling styles. Students identified as gifted displayed a stronger preference for imaginative styles, while nongifted children displayed a stronger preference for practical styles. Gender differences were significant. Boys displayed a stronger preference for flexible and thinking styles while girls displayed a stronger preference for organized and feeling styles. Two gifted-by-gender interactions also wer significant. Compared with boys identified, girls identified as gifted were more likely tp prefer imaginative styles. Furthermore, although boys generally expressed a stronger preference for thinking than feeling, non-gifted boys expressed a stronger preference for thinking than did boys identified as gifted.",555.0,Temperament-based learning styles of identified gifted and nongifted students,2000.0
"Finding g: Easy viewing through higher order factor analysis   The purpose for this paper is to illustrate the usefulness of higher order factor analysis in demonstrating the presence of general intelligence as the factor underlying performance on 13 indicators of four of Gardner's (1983) multiple intelligences. Data from Plucker, Callahan, and Tomchin (1996) was reanalyzed using maximum likelihood extraction with oblique rotation. The oblique correlation matrix was factor analyzed. consistent with Carroll's (1993) factor analytic survey of human cognitive abilities, results correlations between first-order factors.",556.0,Finding g: Easy viewing through higher order factor analysis,2000.0
"Flip sides of the same coin or marching to the beat of different drummers? A response to Pyryt   Pyryt has raised important questions about the results reported in Plucker, Callahan, and Tomchin (1996). Although Pyryt's comments focus directly on statistical issues upon which we generally agree), he indirectly touches on some major issues related to contemporary intelligence theory and the use of alternative assessments. Our different approaches to these conceptual issues highlight important areas for future research and practice, illustrating the value of this type of intellectual debate for the fields of gifted education and talent development.",557.0,Flip sides of the same coin or marching to the beat of different drummers?

"Mentors for gifted underachieving males: Developing potential and realizing promise   The literature focusing on mentorships and underachieving gifted young men is almost nonexistent. To address this need, the researchers examined the mentorship experiences of three students who characterized various aspects of giftedness and underachievement in males. The findings of the study revealed a single core category with three attendent subcategories. The influence of a significant adult on a young person was the dominant category. Several related subcategories reinforced the importance of the mentor: mentors' open-minded and nonjudgmental characteristics; consistent and personalized social/emotional strategies and advocacy; and strength and interest-based strategies for intervention to reverse underachievement. These results underscore the critical effectiveness of mentorships, on underachievement, regardless of age, environment, and socioeconomic background. Implications of the findings are presented that highlight the successful features of the mentor-protege relationship.",558.0,Mentors for gifted underachieving males: Developing potential and realizing promise,2000.0

"Musical talent: Innate or acquired? Perceptions of students, parents, and teachers   Secondary analysis of descriptive data concerning musically gifted students, their parents, and their teachers yields distinctive attribution patterns for each group. The patterns describe this group of students as attributing much of their success to inborn ability and hard work. These accomplished students, however, describe family members and friends as discouraging their musical development. Parents, in sharp contrast, report their children as having only ordinary levels of inborn talent, and they attribute their children's musical accomplishments to encouragement provided by family and friends. Teachers in this study attribute students' musical development to innate talent, hard work, and schooling. Differences among these attribution patterns are surprising, but are consistent with research that suggests that individuals often make causal attributions that are self-serving, giving a good deal of credit to their own characteristics or influence.",561.0,"Musical talent: Innate or acquired?

"Defining belief in self: Intelligent young men in an urban high school   To address the paucity of research on high-ability youth in urban environments, this article chronicles the experiences of six intelligent young men in an urban high school. Through a qualitative research design that integrated features of case study and ethnographic research, the study examined how urban life experiences influenced academic achievement. The six cases reported in this study are a subset of 12 cases (Hebert, 1993) that contributed to a larger study (Reis, Hebert, Diaz, Maxfield, & Ratley, 1995) of talented students in an urban high school. Major findings for the high-ability achieving males were a strong belief in self that incorporated an inner will, aspirations, heightened sensitivity, and a multicultural awareness and appreciation. Data analysis on the participants identified the following factors that influenced the strong belief in self: relationships with supportive adults; involvement in extracurricular activities, sports, special programs, and summer school experiences; and family support. Implications of the findings are presented along with suggestions for meeting the educational needs of intelligent young men in urban high schools.",562.0,Defining belief in self: Intelligent young men in an urban high school,2000.0
"Assessing leadership among Chinese secondary students in Hong Kong: The use of the Poets Rating Scale for Leadership   The leadership characteristics of 163 Chinese secondary students in Hong Kong were assessed with the use of the Roets Rating Scale for Leadership (RRSL). Higher self-ratings were found for characteristics related to aspiring to leadership and achievement, openness to novel experiences and different perspectives, and high energy level than for other characteristics. Three dimensions identifiable as task orientation, leadership self-efficacy, and leadership flexibility emerged, testifying to the complexity of leadership skills and characteristics. The study also provided evidence that the RRSL was a viable self-report measure of leadership among Chinese adolescents with acceptable reliability and convergent validity with other measures of leadership based on observed behavioral characteristics. Repeated assessment also indicated that the RRSL could be used to monitor the effects of leadership training programs.",563.0,Assessing leadership among Chinese secondary students in Hong Kong: The use of the Poets Rating Scale for Leadership,2000.0
"Compensation strategies used by high-ability students with learning disabilities who succeed in college   To investigate how high-ability students with learning disabilities succeed in postsecondary academic environments, 12 young adults with disabilities who were successful at the university level were studied. Extensive interviews with these young adults provided examples of the problems faced by high-ability students with learning disabilities, as well as the specific compensation strategies they used to address and overcome these problems. Four of the participants had been identified as having a learning disability in elementary school; and two were not diagnosed until college. The participants believed that having a learning disability was considered by elementary or secondary school personnel as synonymous with below-average ability. The reported that content remediation, other than instruction in compensatory strategies, was usually provided in elementary and secondary school learning disability programs. In this article, the compensation strategies used by academically gifted students who succeeded in college are discussed. These include: study strategies, cognitive/learning strategies, compensatory supports, environmental accommodation, opportunities for counseling, self-advocacy, and the development of an individual plan incorporating a focus on metacognition and executive functions.",564.0,Compensation strategies used by high-ability students with learning disabilities who succeed in college,2000.0

"Unthinkable thoughts: Education of gifted students   The advent of a new millenium is an appropriate time to insider some unthinkable thoughts, those thoughts that make us so uncomfortable that most professionals prefer to them. Yet, if progress is to be made, such to our professional roles must be confronted. such ugly questions are considered for gifted education, together with suggested actions to cope with them. 1. Is there really such an entity as a gifted child? 2. Is there such an entity as gifted education? 3. Is there such an entity as special personnel preparation for teachers of gifted students? 4. Is the application of special services for gifted students sufficient in scope and intensity to make a difference in the classroom?

"Economically disadvantaged students in a school for the academically gifted: A postpositivist inquiry into individual and family adjustment   In this paper, we report the results of an inquiry into the effects of the placement of five economically disadvantaged minority students from central Harlem, who were Sed. in kindergarten as potentially academically through nontraditional means, ill a school for Istudents. Achievement and aptitude test-data and qualitative data collected during the students' first year at the school support the conclusion that the students were appropriately placed and adjusted well academically, socially, and emotionally. Follow-up data suggest that the students' academic careers have, in the six years since the original data were collected, for the most gait progressed well. We present assertions that begin to explain why students have succeeded academically despite being at risk for educational disadvantage. These assertions concern the students themselves, their families, their school and Project Synergy, through whose activities the students were identified as potentially gifted.",569.0,Economically disadvantaged students in a school for the academically gifted: A postpositivist inquiry into individual and family adjustment,2000.0
"Sociocultural problem-solving skills in preschoolers of high intellectual ability   This study investigated the ability-related differences in planning skill on a sociocultural task, as well as the performance impact of working with a peer. Shopping routes through a model grocery store mere planned by 30 average-ability and 20 high-ability preschool children. All subjects planned a total of five shopping trips. The first and last trips were completed alone, while the three middle trips were either completed alone, with a same-ability peer, or with a peer of different ability. Data were analyzed with a series of multivariate is of variance (MANOVA) with a within-subjects representing the measure of planning skill across Lists 2, 3, and 4. Results indicates that preschool-aged,did not differ in planning skill on the basis of ability. In addition, high-ability preschoolers performed equally when working alone, with a peer or with a peer of less ability.",570.0,Sociocultural problem-solving skills in preschoolers of high intellectual ability,2000.0
"Self-concept in gifted youth: An investigation employing the Piers-Harris subscales   The Piers-Harris Children's Self-Concept Scale was used to investigate the self-concept of 368 intellectually gifted children in grades 4-12. Previous research had suggested that differences by gender and grade level might be masked by reporting only global self-concept scores; however, few studies reported subscale scores. In this population, gender was not a significant variable for global self-concept. Significant gender differences were observed on three subscales: Behavior, Intellectual and School Status, and Anxiety. Females rated themselves higher on the first two and males on the latter. School level was a significant variable for global self-concept: students in junior high school reported lower self-concept than did students in either elementary school or high school. Similar results were observed with the Behavior subscale. The present study supports the view that a global score for self-concept can mask underlying differences when subscale scores are summed.",571.0,Self-concept in gifted youth: An investigation employing the Piers-Harris subscales,2000.0
"The research processes of gifted students: A case study   This case study investigated the research processes and authentic learning experiences of 10 junior high students as they completed independent research projects in a class for gifted students. Students experienced the most difficulty in exploring and forming a focus. Although students used a variety of information resources, they did not access some available information sources and, in some cases, experienced difficulty extracting relevant information. The professional services of public and school librarians were not utilized to assist in the research project. Only 3 of the 10 gifted students demonstrated all of the characteristics of authentic learning in their final products. Suggestions are made on how to alter the process to make independent research projects produce more authentic learning experiences.",572.0,The research processes of gifted students: A case study,2000.0
