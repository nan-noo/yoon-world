"PERSONALITY DIMENSIONS OF GIFTED ADOLESCENTS - A REVIEW OF THE EMPIRICAL LITERATURE   This article is an overview of the empirical literature on personality dimensions of gifted individuals. The literature review is focused around four key issues: differences between gifted individuals and same-age nongifted individuals; differences between gifted individuals and chronologically order, nongifted individuals; differences between gifted males and gifted females; differences between gifted achievers and under-achievers.",980.0,PERSONALITY DIMENSIONS OF GIFTED ADOLESCENTS - A REVIEW OF THE EMPIRICAL LITERATURE,1988.0
"FAMILY ENVIRONMENTS OF UNDERACHIEVING GIFTED STUDENTS   A comparison of the family environments of a sample of 22 underachieving gifted students to those described in studies of eminent and gifted achievers provides some themes which can be helpful to the parents of gifted children. Family structure, climate, and values showed some similarities as well as some dramatic differences. The main themes applicable to parenting are: (a) extreme amounts of early attention may confer too early adult status and attention dependence, (b) consistency between parents is more critical than any particular style of parenting, (c) independence for home-work completion is characteristic of achievers, (d) parent interest in and satisfaction with personal careers and intrinsic learning must be specifically communicated to children in order to provide appropriate achieving role models, and (e) reasonable standards of family organization appear important for achievement.",981.0,FAMILY ENVIRONMENTS OF UNDERACHIEVING GIFTED STUDENTS,1988.0

"SECRETS OF AWARD WINNING PROGRAMS FOR THE GIFTED IN MATHEMATICS   The objectives of this study were to identify high schools with well-developed programs for gifted students in mathematics and to isolate the key ingredients of such programs. The first objective involved analyzing data from 509 schools. Four stringent criteria were applied to isolate the top 2% of the schools, and these were labeled exemplary schools. Each of the exemplary schools had developed viable independent study research programs in mathematics. The key ingredients included the following: dynamic research-oriented math teachers, development of problem-centered courses that used no text or tests, active administrative support, active recruiting, and contact with nearby universities. None of the schools had above average facilities or extensive computer resources.",983.0,SECRETS OF AWARD WINNING PROGRAMS FOR THE GIFTED IN MATHEMATICS,1988.0

"EFFECTS OF THE REVOLVING DOOR IDENTIFICATION MODEL ON CREATIVE PRODUCTIVITY AND SELF-EFFICACY   The study examined the effects of the Revolving Door Identification Model on student creative productivity and self-efficacy as regards creative productivity. Seventh and eighth grade students who had participated in RDIM programs for at least four years were compared with comparable students in a near-by district who received no services. Participation in an RDIM program and number of projects in school were identified as significant predictors of creative productivity outside school. RDIM students who did Type III projects were more likely to report that the project affected their career goals, improved research skills, led to a more positive attitude toward school, and increased insight into personal strengths and weaknesses than students not in the RDIM program who completed major school projects.",986.0,EFFECTS OF THE REVOLVING DOOR IDENTIFICATION MODEL ON CREATIVE PRODUCTIVITY AND SELF-EFFICACY,1988.0
"THE MULTIPLE MENU MODEL FOR DEVELOPING DIFFERENTIATED CURRICULUM FOR THE GIFTED AND TALENTED   The history of curriculum development for the gifted has witnessed a seesaw effect rather than an appropriate balance between authentic knowledge (content) and instructional techniques (process). The Multiple Menu Model is a practical set of planning guides that can assist curriculum developers in combining content with instructional strategies. Menus are provided in the areas of Knowledge, Instructional Objectives and Student Activities, Instructional Strategies, Instructional Sequences, and Artistic Modification. Each of the five planning menus is designed to provide specific forms of guidance for the construction of curricular material that is consistent with generally agreed upon goals of gifted education. A lesson planning guide is designed to synthesize and insure representation of the content and process selected from the respective menus.",987.0,THE MULTIPLE MENU MODEL FOR DEVELOPING DIFFERENTIATED CURRICULUM FOR THE GIFTED AND TALENTED,1988.0
"THE PERCEIVED COMPETENCE OF INTELLECTUALLY TALENTED STUDENTS   Upper primary gifted boys and girls were compared with nongifted children on self-perceptions of competence in four areas: cognitive, physical, social, and general self-worth. Gifted students perceived themselves as more competent than their nongifted peers in the cognitive and general self-worth areas, but not in the physical and social areas. Of the gifted children, those in a full-time segregated program had relatively lower perceived cognitive and physical competence than those in a part-time extension program. Sex differences were also observed.",988.0,THE PERCEIVED COMPETENCE OF INTELLECTUALLY TALENTED STUDENTS,1988.0
"DO TEACHERS FAVOR HIGH ACHIEVERS   Teacher interactions during mathematics lessons with high achieving and other students were examined in this study. At the grade 7 level teachers interacted less frequendy and for less time with the best students. The data for the grade 10 sample were more complex. Teachers again spent less time interacting with the best students but called on them more frequently for certain interactions. Greater teacher attention given to high achieving boys compared with high achieving girls, reported in earlier research, was not replicated in this study.",989.0,DO TEACHERS FAVOR HIGH ACHIEVERS,1988.0
"HIGH ABILITY LEARNING-DISABLED STUDENTS - HOW ARE THEY DIFFERENT   The purpose of the research was to investigate what characteristics distinguish High Ability/LD students from learning disabled students with average cognitive ability and from high ability students. One hundred-twelve high ability or learning disabled students in grades four through six participated in the study: High Ability, High Ability/LD, and LD/Average. A variety of instruments was used to assess and compare cognitive and motivational patterns in the three groups. Discriminant analyses indicated that the three groups are distinguishable. As might be expected, the greatest group difference existed between high ability nondisabled students and both learning disabled populations. A second discriminant function provided information about differences between the two learning disabled populations.",990.0,HIGH ABILITY LEARNING-DISABLED STUDENTS - HOW ARE THEY DIFFERENT,1988.0
"STATE ASSOCIATIONS FOR GIFTED TALENTED EDUCATION   With continued national emphasis on excellence in education, an increasing number of new parent/educator advocacy associations for gifted and talented education have been formed. A national survey was conducted to determine membership status, dues, and staffing patterns of state associations for the gifted and to gather information about services and programs available for gifted children, their parents, and teachers. Membership ranges between 50 and 6,000 and consists mostly of parents and educators togefher. With the exception of 10 states, the G/T advocacy groups are organized, led, and managed by volunteers. Most associations publish a quarterly newsletter, and several associations distribute print material for parents on the nature and needs of gifted children and provide in-service for new and experienced teachers of the gifted. Each state association holds an annual state-wide conference with keynote speakers and numerous break-out sessions. Annual awards in various categories are presented at the conferences.",991.0,STATE ASSOCIATIONS FOR GIFTED TALENTED EDUCATION,1988.0
"GIFTED CHILDRENS RESPONSES TO A COGNITIVE STRESSOR   The purpose of this study was to investigate the differences in physiological responses to an induced cognitive stressor when comparing intellectually gifted children with nongifted children. After the administration of a color-discrimination stressor, the skin temperature change for 30 intellectually gifted junior high school students was compared to that of 30 nongifted students. The temperature change of the gifted sample was significantly less than that of the nongifted group, and the recovery time of the gifted group was considerably faster. The findings indicate that gifted children may be less prone to react to cognitive stressors and recover more rapidly than nongifted children.",992.0,GIFTED CHILDRENS RESPONSES TO A COGNITIVE STRESSOR,1988.0
"GIFTED ADOLESCENTS ATTITUDES TOWARD THEIR GIFTEDNESS   The purpose of this study was to assess gifted adolescents' views of their own giftedness and their perceptions regarding how giftedness is viewed by others. One hundred eighty-four gifted adolescents completed an open-ended questionnaire on giftedness. Resutts indicated that their views of giftedness were not unidimensional. They were positive about their giftedness but did not believe that others were positive. Also, gifted adolescents viewed giftedness as positive with regard to their personal growth and academic performance but as negative in social relations with others. Gifted adolescents have strongly mixed attitudes about their giftedness.",993.0,GIFTED ADOLESCENTS ATTITUDES TOWARD THEIR GIFTEDNESS,1988.0

ON COPING AND DEFENDING - APPLYING BRUNER PERSONAL GROWTH PRINCIPLES TO WORKING WITH GIFTED TALENTED STUDENTS   Dealing succesfully with the changes and challenges associated with public recognition of giftedness is crucial for bright and talented students. In this article the authors critically examine popular approaches for working with gifted students in affective areas. They present two systems for helping gifted students handle the social-emotional tasks involved in actualizing their abilities and Explore implications of these systems for persons closely involved with gifted/talented students.,996.0,ON COPING AND DEFENDING - APPLYING BRUNER PERSONAL GROWTH PRINCIPLES TO WORKING WITH GIFTED TALENTED STUDENTS,1988.0
"FAMILY SYSTEMS CHARACTERISTICS AND UNDERACHIEVING GIFTED ADOLESCENT MALES   The family systems of 45 underachieving and 45 achieving gifted male adolescents were compared on the variables of family functionality, family satisfaction, family environment (conflict, achievement orientation, independence, and expressiveness), and achievement satisfaction. Families with achieving and underachieving gifted students did not differ on the measure of family functionality. Achievement satisfaction and family satisfaction differentiated families on the basis of the status of their gifted student; achievement satisfaction differentiated functional from dysfunctional families. Families with achieving gifted students expressed higher achievement satisfaction than families with underachieving gifted students, and dysfunctional families with an underachieving adolescent were less satisfied with their child's achievement than were functional families with an underachieving student.",997.0,FAMILY SYSTEMS CHARACTERISTICS AND UNDERACHIEVING GIFTED ADOLESCENT MALES,1988.0
EMOTIONAL ADJUSTMENT OF GIFTED-CHILDREN   The personality functioning of 90 children with intelligence quotients greater than 135 was examined with the Child Behavior Checklist(CBCL) and the Child Behavior Checklist-Teacher's Reobrt Form (CBCL-TRF). Results for the CBCL and the CBCL-TRF demonstrated that the incidence of psychopathology in this sample was comparable to that in the normative population. Only 9% of the sample were rated as having clinical levels of psychopathology. Children with intelligence quotients greater than 150 were shown to have no greater levels of psychopathology than those with intelligence quotients between 136 and 140.,998.0,EMOTIONAL ADJUSTMENT OF GIFTED-CHILDREN,1988.0

"CURRICULAR DECISION-MAKING FOR THE EDUCATION OF YOUNG GIFTED-CHILDREN   Four basic tenets must be kept in mind regarding curricular decisions for young gifted children. These tenets govern the direction that curriculum for them may take and the manner in which educators interact with these children. First, young gifted children have special learning needs. They differ in that they have the capability to learn at greater depth and more quickly, and they have interests which may predate those of their peers. Second, curriculum should be drawn from their special interests and needs. Next, the work of childhood is play; therefore, the curriculum of young gifted children must emphasize exploration and play. Finally, young gifted children should be engaged in the curricular decision making process. This article elaborates these four principles in curricular decision making for young gifted children.",1006.0,CURRICULAR DECISION-MAKING FOR THE EDUCATION OF YOUNG GIFTED-CHILDREN,1988.0
"PRECOCIOUS READING-ABILITY - WHAT DOES IT MEAN   The results of studies of precocious reading ability are reviewed, and the implications of these results for parents, teachers, and educational policy makers are discussed. Precocious reading ability is a complex skill, and levels of specific subskills vary widely among individuals. Although precocious reading ability is moderately associated with general intelligence, some highly .intelligent children do not read early and some precocious readers are of average or subnormal intelligence. Although parents should not expect to be able to teach their infants to read, they may encourage the early development of reading through natural and mutually enjoyable activities.",1007.0,PRECOCIOUS READING-ABILITY - WHAT DOES IT MEAN,1988.0

"A CROSS-SECTIONAL DEVELOPMENTAL-STUDY OF THE SOCIAL-RELATIONS OF STUDENTS WHO ENTER COLLEGE EARLY   Sixty-three students who had entered college at age 14 or younger supplied data on the number and ages of their friends, time spent together in various activities, number of times various sensitive topics were discussed, and degree of shared intimacy. Striking differences appeared during the first and second years between the proportions of the friendship investment with agemates and older university classmates. By junior year, and thereafter, however, early entrants appeared to have established relations with older students of breadth and depth at least equivalent to those already existing with agemates. Young college graduates were pronouncedly more invested in relationships with older individuals. These findings suggest that early entrants support each other during the first and second years at the university and use these relations as a base for developing fulfilling friendships with older students as upperclasspersons and graduates.",1009.0,A CROSS-SECTIONAL DEVELOPMENTAL-STUDY OF THE SOCIAL-RELATIONS OF STUDENTS WHO ENTER COLLEGE EARLY,1988.0
"TEACHERS PERCEPTIONS OF GIFTEDNESS   This investigation examined prospective and experienced teachers' perceptions of relatedness among abilities. Participants included 111 undergraduate education students without teaching experience and 79 graduate students who were experienced teachers. Students were required to indicate the resemblance among 20 different kinds of abilities, using sorting, similarity ratings, and/or trait ratings. These data were analyzed using clustering, multidimensional scaling, and factor analysis approaches. Both prospective and experienced teachers tended to agree on five categories of giftedness: analytic or cognitive ability, personality and social Skills, creative arts, motor skitts, and verbal ability. Although the findings resemble Gardner's (1983) ""multiple intelligences"" and suggest that teachers hold appropriate beliefs about relationships among abilities, further investigations are required to explore the extent to which their conceptions relate to their day-to-day interactions, judgments, and decisions in their classrooms",1010.0,TEACHERS PERCEPTIONS OF GIFTEDNESS,1988.0
"STUDENTS PERCEPTIONS OF ABILITY   The present study investigated ability perceptions of 29 intellectually gifted students in the mainstream and 71 average achievers. The Perception of Ability Scale for Students (PASS: formerly the Student's Perception of Ability Scale) was used to assess ability perceptions on three occasions over two years. The results indicated that gifted students held significantly higher ability perceptions in all areas tapped by the PASS except School Satisfaction and Penmanship/Neatness. In general, perceptions of ability were stable for both groups across the two years, although a decline in school satisfaction was noted for both groups. The results suggest that ability perceptions become stable as patterns of performance become stable.",1011.0,STUDENTS PERCEPTIONS OF ABILITY,1988.0
