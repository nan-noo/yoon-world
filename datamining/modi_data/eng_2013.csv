"A Model for Screening Twice-Exceptional Students (Gifted With Learning Disabilities) Within a Response to Intervention Paradigm twice-exceptional; special populations; underserved gifted; identification; assessment; definition and; or conception of giftedness; talent; reading; curriculum; mathematics; curriculum The purpose of this article is to present a model for screening for twice-exceptional status (i.e., gifted students who have a learning disability). Curriculum-based measures (Monitoring Instructional Responsiveness: Reading and Monitoring Instructional Responsiveness: Math) were administered to 1,242 third-grade students within a Response to Intervention paradigm. When gifted status is tentatively defined as high performance (i.e., 84th percentile and higher) on a Monitoring Instructional Responsiveness reading probe, 5.48% of students exhibited deficits in (math) performance consistent with a significant discrepancy between reading and math (i.e., reading score - math score); 4.83% exhibited a discrepancy in reading (i.e., math score - reading). These values are based on observed scores using the following formula to define a discrepancy: 1.5(SD) x SEe. Only 2.1% exhibited a math discrepancy and 1.13% a reading discrepancy based on predicted scores, which takes regression to the mean into account. Using various cut score criteria, practitioners can select from less than 1% to about 10% for screening purposes. When using predicted (rather than observed) scores and more stringent cut score criteria, percentages decline, as expected. Recommendations for using this process for screening are provided, as are implications for best practice, particularly the impact of using more or less conservative criteria for screening twice exceptional students.",166.0,A Model for Screening Twice-Exceptional Students (Gifted With Learning Disabilities) Within a Response to Intervention Paradigm,2013.0
"Differences Between Children With Dyslexia Who Are and Are Not Gifted in Verbal Reasoning twice-exceptional; reading; elementary; middle school New findings are presented for children in Grades 1 to 9 who qualified their families for a multigenerational family genetics study of dyslexia (impaired word decoding/spelling) who had either superior verbal reasoning (n = 33 at or above 1 2/3 standard deviation, superior or better range; 19% of these children) or average verbal reasoning (n = 31 below population mean but above -2/3 standard deviation, average range; 18% of these children). Evidence-based rationale and results supporting the tested hypotheses are provided: (a) twice exceptional students with superior verbal reasoning and dyslexia significantly outperformed those with average verbal reasoning and dyslexia on reading, spelling, morphological, and syntactic skills, (b) but not on verbal working memory behavioral markers of genetically based dyslexia related to impaired phonological and orthographic word-form storage and processing, naming orthographic symbols (phonological loop), writing orthographic symbols (orthographic loop), and supervisory attention (focus, switch, sustain, or monitor attention). Superior verbal reasoning may mask dyslexia if only very low achievement is used to identify this disorder of oral word reading and written spelling. Instruction for twice exceptional students who have dyslexia, but are also verbally gifted, should focus not only on oral word reading and written spelling but also on the impaired working memory components within intellectually engaging lesson sets. These findings for gifted students with dyslexia are situated within the broader context of the many kinds of twice exceptionalities related to specific learning disabilities that exist in school-age children and youth.",167.0,Differences Between Children With Dyslexia Who Are and Are Not Gifted in Verbal Reasoning,2013.0
"Creativity and Working Memory in Gifted Students With and Without Characteristics of Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder: Lifting the Mask creativity; twice-exceptional; special populations; underserved gifted There have been some behavioral indicators and some types of task performance that suggest greater creativity in students with attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD). This evidence would appear counterintuitive given that lower working memory (i.e., holding information in mind for novel recombinations) has often been documented in students with ADHD. Thus, the purpose of this study was to assess working memory and creativity in two groups of gifted students (i.e., with characteristics of ADHD, n = 17, and without ADHD characteristics, n = 20), who were equivalent in fluid intelligence. Significant differences were found indicating that gifted students with ADHD characteristics had not only poorer working memory but also significantly greater creativity than those gifted students without these characteristics. These results were discussed in terms of creative potential, which could serve as an identifier and as a pathway to instruction.",168.0,Creativity and Working Memory in Gifted Students With and Without Characteristics of Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder: Lifting the Mask,2013.0
"Twice-Exceptional Learners' Perspectives on Effective Learning Strategies twice-exceptional learner; learning strategies; school experiences; qualitative; survey This mixed-methods study investigates the perspectives of twice-exceptional students on learning strategies that have been recommended for them in the literature. Have the strategies recommended in the literature been implemented? Do students perceive the strategies to be beneficial in helping them learn? Participants represented a broad range of coexisting exceptionalities and ranged in age from 10 to 23 years. While mainly qualitative, this study was informed by a survey adapted from the Possibilities for Learning survey. Qualitative in-depth interviews provided rich descriptions of which learning strategies were facilitators and barriers. Findings indicated that participants perceived that their overall school experiences failed to assist them in learning to their potential, although they were able to use their strengths to circumvent their weaknesses. Implications for teachers included allowing twice-exceptional learners more ownership over their learning and more choice and flexibility in topic, method of learning, assessment, pace, and implementation of group collaboration.",169.0,Twice-Exceptional Learners' Perspectives on Effective Learning Strategies,2013.0
"The Influence of Primary Caregivers in Fostering Success in Twice-Exceptional Children twice-exceptional children; academic success; parents Using grounded theory, this study investigated primary caregivers' perceptions of the role they play in influencing the academic success of students formally identified as twice-exceptional. Data from interviews were coded and analyzed for themes. Results indicated that primary caregivers (mothers) perceived that they played a major role in the academic success of their twice-exceptional children, first by recognizing their children's gifts as well as disabilities and then by assuming responsibility for the development of their children's potential. They sought professional evaluations, provided or secured educational supports, shaped their children's healthy perceptions of their disabilities, and taught them how to advocate for themselves while simultaneously maintaining high expectations for their children, despite their disabilities. Implications of the findings are discussed, and areas for future research are outlined.",170.0,The Influence of Primary Caregivers in Fostering Success in Twice-Exceptional Children,2013.0
"Twice-Exceptional Learners: Who Needs to Know What? multivariate analyses; quantitative methodologies; assessment; twice-exceptional; special populations; underserved gifted Twice-exceptionality is gaining increasing recognition in the gifted education literature but little is understood about the knowledge and awareness of this concept within the educational and psychological community, or about professionals' experience working with this population of learners. Three-hundred and seventeen individuals completed an online Twice-Exceptional Needs Assessment, which consisted of 14 questions assessing issues pertaining to twice-exceptionality knowledge and experience, as well as knowledge of policies relevant to both gifted and special education. Results indicated that educators were more familiar with standards within their specific area of expertise (e.g., gifted or special education) and that fewer professionals were familiar with the use of Response to Intervention with twice-exceptional children. Gifted education professionals had significantly more knowledge and experience with twice-exceptionality than did professionals in other domains. We conclude with implications for educators and recommendations for expanding professional understanding of twice-exceptionality outside the field of gifted education to meet twice-exceptional students' multifaceted needs.",171.0,Twice-Exceptional Learners: Who Needs to Know What?,2013.0
"Characteristics Leading Teachers to Nominate Secondary Students as Gifted in Spain teacher; nomination; gifted; secondary education; Spain What are the characteristics leading teachers to nominate gifted students in Spain? To answer this question, several demographic (i.e., gender, grade) and psychological (i.e., multiple intelligences, emotional intelligence, intellectual aptitude, and divergent thinking) characteristics of 563 secondary students nominated as gifted by their teachers were analyzed. Results showed a general gifted profile of the nominated students defined by higher scores in their naturalist and social intelligences, stress management, and verbal, mechanical, and spatial reasoning. Additional analysis indicated that students' gender and grade also influenced teachers' nominations of gifted students. Based on the associations among the demographic and psychological characteristics included in this study, nominated students could be classified in five specific gifted profiles, namely, moderately gifted students, social-emotionally gifted students, artistically gifted students, intellectually gifted students, and generally gifted students. Discussion of the limitations of the study, directions for future research, and educational implications of the study are provided.",172.0,Characteristics Leading Teachers to Nominate Secondary Students as Gifted in Spain,2013.0
"What Are the Odds of That? A Primer on Understanding Logistic Regression quantitative methodologies; policy; policy analysis; assessment The purpose of this Methodological Brief is to present a brief primer on logistic regression, a commonly used technique when modeling dichotomous outcomes. Using data from the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88), logistic regression techniques were used to investigate student-level variables in eighth grade (i.e., enrolled in a gifted class, gender, and socioeconomic status) that were associated with taking an Advanced Placement course in the 10th grade. Through the use of the NELS:88 data, the authors provide an example of how to interpret both categorical and continuous independent variables and illustrate how model fit can be assessed.",173.0,What Are the Odds of That?

"Three Paradigms of Gifted Education: In Search of Conceptual Clarity in Research and Practice definition and; or conception of giftedness; talent; programming; service delivery models; philosophical; theoretical The purpose of the article is to articulate and compare three major approaches or paradigms of gifted education, so that researchers and practitioners can be more explicit about their assumptions, goals, and educational strategies in their research and practice. We first define the term paradigm, and then delineate three paradigms in the historical context. We then compare and contrast the three paradigms to elucidate their continuities and discontinuities. Finally, we discuss the importance of articulating the paradigmatic nature of approaches for educational and research purposes. The ultimate purpose of articulating the distinct approaches is to seek a common research agenda with clarity, rigor, and relevance.",174.0,Three Paradigms of Gifted Education: In Search of Conceptual Clarity in Research and Practice,2013.0
"The Impact of Advanced Geometry and Measurement Curriculum Units on the Mathematics Achievement of First-Grade Students mathematics; primary; advanced; curriculum The goal of Project M2 was to develop and field-test challenging geometry and measurement units for K-2 students. The units were developed using recommendations from gifted, mathematics, and early childhood education. This article reports on achievement results for students in Grade 1 at 12 diverse sites in four states using the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills (ITBS) mathematics concepts subtest and an open-response assessment. Using HLM, as expected there were no statistical differences between the experimental (n = 186) and comparison (n = 174) groups on the ITBS (91% of the items focused on number). Statistically significant differences (p < .001) favoring the experimental group were found on the open-response assessment with a large effect size (d = 1.88). Thus the experimental group exhibited a deeper understanding of geometry and measurement concepts on the open-response assessment while performing as well on a traditional measure that covered all Grade 1 mathematics.",175.0,The Impact of Advanced Geometry and Measurement Curriculum Units on the Mathematics Achievement of First-Grade Students,2013.0
"Additional Validity Evidence and Across-Group Equivalency of the HOPE Teacher Rating Scale factor analysis; identification; assessment; special populations/underserved gifted; low income The HOPE Scale was developed to identify academic and social components of giftedness and talent in elementary-aged students with particular attention to students from low-income and/or culturally diverse families. Based on previous findings, additional research was conducted on revisions made to the HOPE Scale. Items were added, and 71 teachers completed the HOPE Scale on 1,700 diverse students. The HOPE Scale was evaluated for differential item and test functioning with regard to gender, ethnic/racial, and income groups. Differential item functioning was not found with ethnic/racial or income group membership, but it existed for gender. HOPE Scale scores were also compared with achievement test scores to contribute criterion-related validity information. Results indicate that HOPE Scale scores account for approximately 52% to 58% of achievement test scores.",176.0,Additional Validity Evidence and Across-Group Equivalency of the HOPE Teacher Rating Scale,2013.0
"Minority Performance on the Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test, Second Edition, Versus the Cognitive Abilities Test, Form 6: One Gifted Program's Experience NNAT2; CogAT6; WISC-IV; gifted; talent; minority; underrepresentation The Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test, Second Edition (NNAT2), is used widely to screen students for possible inclusion in talent development programs. The NNAT2 claims to provide a more culturally neutral evaluation of general ability than tests such as Form 6 of the Cognitive Abilities Test (CogAT6), which has Verbal and Quantitative batteries in addition to a Nonverbal battery. This study compared the performance of 5,833 second graders who took the CogAT6 and 4,038 kindergartners, first graders, and second graders who took the NNAT2 between 2005 and 2011 as part of a grade-wide screening for a gifted program. Comparison between minorities and Whites on the CogAT6 and the NNAT2 found slightly larger gaps on the CogAT6 Composite for Hispanics and English-Language Learners (ELL) but the same gap for Black students. Considered alone, the Nonverbal battery of CogAT6 produced smaller gaps than the NNAT2 for Blacks, Hispanics, Asians, and ELL students. Fisher's exact tests showed no significant differences between the CogAT6 Composite and the NNAT2 in subgroup identification rates at hypothetical cuts for gifted identification (top 20%, 10%, or 5%), except for Asian and ELL students. The CogAT6 Nonverbal score appeared to identify as many or more high-ability students from underrepresented groups as the NNAT2. Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Fourth Edition, follow-up on the top 5% showed greater predictive validity for the CogAT6 Composite. These results suggest that gifted programs should not assume that using a figural screening test such as the NNAT2, without other adjustments to selection protocol, will address minority underrepresentation.",177.0,"Minority Performance on the Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test, Second Edition, Versus the Cognitive Abilities Test, Form 6: One Gifted Program's Experience",2013.0
"Evaluating Interventions for Young Gifted Children Using Single-Subject Methodology: A Preliminary Study gifted; single-subject design; young children; questioning Single-subject experimental designs have long been used in special education to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions for exceptional children. However, the design has not been used widely in gifted education. In this article, an overview of the main features of single-subject design is presented, and its potential for application in gifted education is discussed. The article concludes with a report of a preliminary single-subject study, conducted with a young gifted child, in which the effects of higher order questioning are investigated.",178.0,Evaluating Interventions for Young Gifted Children Using Single-Subject Methodology: A Preliminary Study,2013.0
"Homeschooling the Gifted: A Parent's Perspective homeschooling; gifted; talented; parents; grounded theory Homeschooling has witnessed a dramatic growth over the past decade. Included in this population are gifted and talented students, yet despite this growth there has been no appreciable increase in the research literature. To better understand the gifted homeschooling family, researchers interviewed 13 parents of homeschooled children their parents identified as being gifted. Four major themes emerged from the data: (a) parents know best, (b) isolation, (c) challenges, and (d) family roles. Findings reveal that these parents decided to homeschool only after numerous attempts to work in collaboration with the public school and that the mothers bore the primary burden of responsibility for homeschooling in these families. Though the move to homeschooling alleviated many of the issues experienced in public school, it brought a different set of challenges to these families. This exploratory study establishes a better understanding of why parents of gifted children ultimately decide to homeschool.",179.0,Homeschooling the Gifted: A Parent's Perspective,2013.0
"High-Ability Students' Participation in Specialized Instructional Delivery Models: Variations by Aptitude, Grade, Gender, and Content Area high-ability; science; math; language arts; gender Established in the early 1970s, the talent search model has garnered strong theoretical and programming support for addressing the academic needs of highly able students. The two main components of the talent search model are discovery (identification) and development (programming) of academic talent. Discovery of academically talented elementary and middle school students occurs via the process of above-level testing, usually offered through university-based centers. The essence of talent search program intervention is acceleration, which has robust research support as the most effective intervention for high-ability students. Whereas talent search identification and programming are university based, talent search participants receive nearly all of their instruction in K-12 settings, where academic acceleration is less likely to be implemented. In this investigation, a large sample of talent search participants (n = 5,844) were asked questions designed to measure the various ways in which the students study mathematics, science, and language arts (writing and reading) in the K-12 setting. More than two thirds of the study sample reported that they were taught in the regular classroom, learning the same material, at the same level and pace as nongifted peers. The type of curriculum differentiation or program delivery model (e.g., small-group instruction) reported by the students varied according to subject area, with the greatest percentage of reports of differentiated delivery in mathematics. Main effects were found for gender, grade, and ability. Implications for school-based accelerative interventions are presented.",180.0,"High-Ability Students' Participation in Specialized Instructional Delivery Models: Variations by Aptitude, Grade, Gender, and Content Area",2013.0
"Reading Comprehension and Fluency Levels Ranges Across Diverse Classrooms: The Need for Differentiated Reading Instruction and Content range; reading achievement; oral reading fluency; instructional differentiation; content This research examined the range of reading fluency and comprehension scores of 1,149 students in five diverse elementary schools, including a gifted and talented magnet school. Results revealed a range in reading comprehension across all schools of 9.2 grade levels in Grade 3, 11.3 in Grade 4, and 11.6 in Grade 5. A similar wide range of oral reading fluency scores was found across all elementary schools, as students scored from below the 10th percentile to above the 90th percentile. These results demonstrate the wide range of reading achievement in diverse populations of students, including gifted students, and the need for teachers to differentiate both reading content and instruction to enable all students to make continuous progress in reading.",181.0,Reading Comprehension and Fluency Levels Ranges Across Diverse Classrooms: The Need for Differentiated Reading Instruction and Content,2013.0
"Gifted Students' Perceptions of Parenting Styles: Associations With Cognitive Ability, Sex, Race, and Age social and/or emotional development and adjustment; secondary age/developmental stage; factor analysis; qualitative methodologies Children whose parents are warm and responsive yet also set limits and have reasonable expectations for their children tend to have better outcomes than their peers whose parents show less warmth and responsiveness, have low expectations, or both. Parenting behavior is related to family race and children's sex, age, and cognitive ability. However, there is no work that examines how children's cognitive abilities are related to their perceptions of their mothers' and fathers' parenting styles and the extent to which these relationships are moderated by race, sex, and age in a sample of gifted students. Participants (N = 332, ages 9-17 years) attended a summer residential program for gifted students and completed the Parental Authority Questionnaire and the verbal battery of the Cognitive Abilities Test. Three main findings emerged. First, factor analyses provided support for the use of the Parent Authority Questionnaire with gifted populations. Second, findings from regression analyses as well as examinations of mean differences by cognitive ability level were consistent with earlier studies suggesting that more cognitively able students were likely to perceive their parents as employing a flexible (i.e., authoritative) parenting style. Finally, consonant with earlier studies with nonidentified populations, age, sex, and race were associated with parenting styles as reported by this group of identified gifted students. Results provide further support for the notion that authoritative parenting promotes positive outcomes for children, particularly those who have been identified as gifted.",182.0,"Gifted Students' Perceptions of Parenting Styles: Associations With Cognitive Ability, Sex, Race, and Age",2013.0
"An Investigation of Play: From the Voices of Fifth- and Sixth-Grade Talented and Gifted Students play; elementary talented and gifted; developmental domains; focus groups; online survey The purpose of this study was to explore the concept of play through the eyes of talented and gifted (TAG) fifth- and sixth-grade students. Three focus groups consisting of fifth- and sixth-grade TAG students were conducted in one urban, one suburban, and one rural school district in the Midwest. Students were asked to describe the value of play in the cognitive, physical, and social domains. Additional open-ended questions were asked about the importance of play and its relevance to their lives. From these results, an online survey was created. Data from an additional 162 fifth- and sixth-grade TAG respondents substantiated that play is a significant activity for learning and socializing in the general classroom, gifted programs, and outside their classrooms. Despite its importance, students experienced structural barriers for time to play. Putting the Research to Use Results of this study hold implications for teachers to acknowledge the value of play as a tool for learning. Children see play as a renewal activity. They see play as motivating and as a way to increase attention, retention, and focus in learning. Children emphasized that play develops teamwork and problem-solving skills. Play enhances meaningful activities in the talented and gifted program as well as the general classroom. Results of this study suggest that parents should acknowledge their children's need for play in all three domains (cognitive, physical, and social) and allow time for self-directed play after school with limits on scheduled activities.",183.0,An Investigation of Play: From the Voices of Fifth- and Sixth-Grade Talented and Gifted Students,2013.0
"The STEM Pathway for Women: What Has Changed? science; curriculum; college or adult; age/developmental stage; gifted females; special populations/underserved gifted In previous decades, researchers have identified a gender gap in the careers and academic achievement of men and women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Recently, it has been suggested that some of these gender gaps no longer exist; however, the picture is more nuanced, for women are represented well in some STEM fields (such as biology) and not in others (such as computer science). The current research employed survey methodology to explore the perceptions of 360 finalists and semifinalists of the prestigious Science Talent Search. Two cohorts of participants who were either in their late 30s (Cohort 2) or late 20s (Cohort 1) were contacted to investigate factors that influenced them to select or not select STEM college majors and occupations. Comparisons between men and women revealed that women recalled having lower self-efficacy in STEM in college than men, and fewer women selected STEM majors as undergraduates. Interest was cited as a major influence for occupational selection for both men and women. Proportionally, more women than men entered fields such as biology and fewer women entered fields such as engineering and physics/astronomy. A greater proportion of older women mentioned leaving STEM because of a lack of flexible hours and needing to attend to family responsibilities. Implications for education and future research are discussed.",184.0,The STEM Pathway for Women: What Has Changed?,2013.0
