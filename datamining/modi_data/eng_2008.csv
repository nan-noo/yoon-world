"Identifying academically gifted English-language learners using nonverbal tests - A comparison of the Raven, NNAT, and CogAT identification; English-language learners; nonverbal tests In this study, the authors compare the validity of three nonverbal tests for the purpose of identifying academically gifted English-language learners (ELLs). Participants were 1,198 elementary children (approximately 40% ELLs). All were administered the Raven Standard Progressive Matrices (Raven), the Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test (NNAT), and Form 6 of the Cognitive Abilities Test (CogAT). Results show that the U.S. national norms for the Raven substantially overestimate the number of high-scoring children; that because of errors in norming, the NNAT overestimates the number of both high-scoring and low-scoring children; that primary-level ELL children score especially poorly on the NNAT; that the standard error of measurement was twice as large for the NNAT as for the Raven or the CogAT; that ELL children scored .5 to .67 standard deviations lower than non-ELL children on the three nonverbal tests; and that none of the nonverbal tests predict achievement for ELL students very well. Putting Research to Use: Do nonverbal reasoning tests level the field for ELL children? Many practitioners have assumed that they do. However ELL children in this study scored 8 to 10 points lower than non-ELL children on the three nonverbal tests. The study also shows that practitioners cannot assume that national norms on the tests are of comparable quality. When put on the same scale as CogAT, Raven scores averaged 10 points higher than CogAT and NNAT scores. For NNAT, the mean is correct but the variability was up to 40% too large. Thus, when using national norms, both the Raven and NNAT will substantially overestimate the number of high-scoring children.",301.0,"Identifying academically gifted English-language learners using nonverbal tests - A comparison of the Raven, NNAT, and CogAT",2008.0
"A study of differentiated instructional change over 3 years differentiated instruction; classroom observation scale; longitudinal change of instructional behavior This study examines Title 1 heterogeneous classroom teachers' instructional behavior change through implementing well-designed research-based curriculum units and attending regular professional development activities across 3 years. Employing an experimental design, this study compares experimental and comparison teachers' behavioral changes as measured by an observation scale of differentiated teaching strategies across 3 years. The results show that experimental teachers received statistically significant and educationally important higher ratings than comparison teachers on differentiated strategy use and effectiveness across 3 years. The study corroborates the research literature that shows that teachers' instructional improvement takes 2 years to manifest its effectiveness and to shape belief in student learning benefits. Putting the Research to Use: This study suggests several areas of practical application. One areas is in the reality versus the myth of professional development. These data suggest the need for multiple years of professional development, interspersed with observations that track the frequency and efficacy of targeting instructional behaviours. Thus, educational reformers must be clear about what change they want teachers to achieve and set about a 2- to 3-year plan for making it happen at the school level. This study also lends support to more systematic approaches to encouraging differentiation. It highlights the need for monitoring classroom implementation. The use of a well-validated observation tool such as the Classroom Observation Scale-Revised provides a venue for ongoing instructional monitoring and improvement. Moreover, embedding content pedagogy in actual curriculum for training reduces the chance for inaccurate teacher inferencing about how to employ a strategy effectively.",302.0,A study of differentiated instructional change over 3 years,2008.0
"You Could Be Doing Brain Surgery: Gifted girls becoming teachers gifted; female; careers; teaching This qualitative study focuses on messages to gifted girls about their choice of a career in teaching. Participants consisted of 18 female teachers identified as gifted. The methodology consisted of semistructured interviews and focus group discussions. Findings indicate that messages of discouragement toward a career in teaching Z, were more numerous and more emphatic than were messages of encouragement. Despite this, these participants were content with and remained committed to teaching careers for the foreseeable future. Participants also mentioned a variety of ways in which their giftedness interacted with their teaching, for their own benefit and that of their students. Recommendations for counselors, teachers, and parents include providing information about the entire range of career options and carefully matching career pathways with the student's interests and dreams rather than the adult's preconceived notions of success or prestige. Putting the Research to Use: There is little question that our society desperately needs teachers who are gifted. Yet gifted students who express an interest in a teaching career are often discouraged by family members, friends, teachers, and counselors. Although it is appropriate to encourage gifted students to pursue careers that might be perceived by society as more prestigious than teaching, it is counterproductive to guide students into careers inconsistent with their interests and values. By the time they are in high school, students who are interested in teaching have often sought out opportunities to interact with children and have engaged in activities such as playing school. These activities indicate the desire to teach, a desire that should be taken seriously. As Delisle (1998, p. 21) put it, My hope is that... we will lecture less and listen more, giving academic and career guidance based upon individual interest patterns rather than preordained societal benchmarks of success. In addition, students should engage in discussions regarding ways in which their intellectual talents may be challenged in teaching to the benefit of all.",303.0,You Could Be Doing Brain Surgery: Gifted girls becoming teachers,2008.0
"The psychology of gifted adolescents as measured by the MMPI-A gifted adolescents; personality; MMPI-A The focus of this study is an examination of gifted students' responses on the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-Adolescent (MMPI-A) in relation to the adolescent norming sample. The comparisons on clinical, content, and Harris-Lingoes scales provide evidence that gifted adolescent boys' and girls' responses do not differ from one another significantly. Furthermore, the data reveal that the assumption held by many that gifted adolescents are more prone to experience heightened rates of neuroticism or personality difficulties is unsupported by the empirical data. Analyses of MMPI-A scores reveal that gifted students' scores are equivalent to or lower than the general population in all areas. The results are discussed as continued empirical evidence that gifted adolescents do not demonstrate abnormal levels of psychological or personality deviance because of their elevated cognitive abilities. Putting the Research to Work: Educators often subscribe to the notion that gifted adolescents are prone to more neurotic behavior or are more often diagnosed with personality disorders than their age mates. The results of this research indicate that notion is false, particularly for adolescents in a residential academy. Educators should be cognizant of the characteristics and needs of gifted adolescents and use that knowledge in planning services and identification plans for these students.",304.0,The psychology of gifted adolescents as measured by the MMPI-A,2008.0
"Do contributors to intellect explain the moral judgment abilities of gifted youth? middle school; age/developmental stage; high school; college or adult To assess reaction time and attributional complexity as factors contributing to the relatively high moral judgment of gifted youth, a sample of 30 gifted youth and 30 college students responded to a computerized measure of moral judgment development, which also indexed reaction time. Additionally, participants completed a measurement of attributional complexity and reported American College Test (ACT) scores. Statistically significant differences favored the gifted in moral judgment development, reaction time, and attributional complexity. Regression analysis revealed that attributional complexity explained a significant amount of variance, whereas ACT scores and reaction times accounted for minimal variance. Although reaction time did not predict moral judgment developmental difference, discussion is offered to suggest how gifted youth, such as those in this study, might benefit from using their reaction time when considering moral situations. Putting the Research to Use: The results of this study support the view that complex information processing and reaction time abilities of gifted youth are transferred to their moral judgment development. In sum, in comparison with a control group of college students, the gifted youth considered in this study appeared to process reasons for moral decisions in a more in-depth manner and were able to do so in a more efficient manner. Currently, it is unknown why and how this occurs, whether obstacles exist that could block this process, and whether practices exist that could help to facilitate these areas. Applications of these findings should therefore expound on these issues so that the utility of research on gifted moral judgment ability is increased. Applied research should also focus on transferring this understanding to general populations in the hopes of affecting the understanding of moral judgment development overall.",305.0,Do contributors to intellect explain the moral judgment abilities of gifted youth?,2008.0
"Talented students in an exemplary career and technical education school - A qualitative inquiry career and technical education; qualitative; secondary education; gifted; talented; underserved gifted; special programs; programming; service delivery Outstanding talents exist in all areas of human endeavor, yet little information exists concerning gifted and talented students in career and technical education (CTE) settings. This qualitative study investigated an exemplary CTE center and the experiences of the rural secondary students who were identified as talented in this setting. Four themes emerged and paralleled suggested practices in gifted education: individualization, student-centered meaningful choices, instructors as developers of talent, and participation in career and technical student organizations. Results offer methods that secondary educators can use to recognize and identify talented CTE students and engage them in challenging, meaningful learning. Findings of positive experiences of talented students in this setting led to the conclusions that CTE programs should be included as part of the continuum of services for gifted and talented youth and that CTE programs should identify, recognize, and serve gifted and talented students.",306.0,Talented students in an exemplary career and technical education school - A qualitative inquiry,2008.0
"A narrow escape - Gifted students' perceptions of Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate programs advanced placement; international baccalaureate; teachers of the gifted; secondary curriculum for the gifted; high school Although limited research exists on the appropriateness of Advanced Placement (AP) and International Baccalaureate (IB) programs for gifted secondary learners, these courses serve as the primary methods of meeting the needs of gifted students in most high schools. This qualitative study investigates how a broad range of gifted secondary students perceives and evaluates the curriculum, instruction, and environments within AP and IB courses. Interviews with 200 students in 23 U.S. high schools revealed that although students believe that AP and IB courses provide a greater level of academic challenge and more favorable learning environments than other existing high school courses, the curriculum and instruction within AP and IB courses are not a good fit for all learners, particularly those from traditionally underserved populations. Recommendations for increasing the fit of AP and IB courses for-and consequently for increasing the participation of-students from traditionally underserved populations are discussed.",307.0,A narrow escape - Gifted students' perceptions of Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate programs,2008.0
"Teachers' negative affect toward academically gifted students negative teacher attitudes; gifted students; evolutionary psychology A frequent reason for teachers not making special provisions for a gifted child is that the child is not fitting in socially. The conjecture that a psychological source of such negative affect has evolved along with human language was tested with a large sample (N = 377) of teachers in England, Scotland, and Australia who were undertaking continuing professional development (CPD) in gifted education. Quantitative indicators of teachers' subconscious feelings toward gifted children were measured using a five-dimensional semantic differential instrument. Oblique factor analysis produced a three-factor structure, namely, general characteristics of gifted children including high cognitive abilities, social misfits, and antisocial leaders. Teachers' negative affect toward gifted children concerns the potential use of high intelligence toward social noncompliance. The factor scores for teachers completing the CPD programs were lower for the social noncompliance factors and higher for the general factor compared with scores of teachers commencing the programs.",308.0,Teachers' negative affect toward academically gifted students,2008.0

Participants included 100 high-ability college students and 196 average-ability college students enrolled in a comprehensive university in the South. Data analysis estimates of internal consistency were moderate, and estimates of relationships with external validity criteria, namely, academic achievement, aspirations, and year in school, moderately supported the validity of each subscale.

"Childhood giftedness and adulthood genius - A historiometric analysis of 291 eminent African Americans minority giftedness; genius; eminence; Creative Achievement Scale; African Americans Although the association between giftedness and genius has been the subject of several retrospective, longitudinal, and historiometric studies, this research concentrated on majority-culture samples. In the current study, Cox's (1926) findings regarding 301 geniuses were replicated on a sample of 291 eminent African Americans. Relative genius was measured by two archival eminence measures (majority White and minority Black culture) and by scores on die Creative Achievement Scale (Ludwig, 1992). Giftedness was assessed by raters blind to the identity of the individuals being evaluated. Control variables were defined for gender, year of birth, status as a living contemporary, and 18 domains of achievement. Multiple regression analyses indicated that adulthood eminence and creative achievement are positively correlated with early giftedness, with an effect size comparable to that found in the Cox study. Furthermore, this association was not moderated by gender, birth year, or most of the remaining variables.",310.0,Childhood giftedness and adulthood genius - A historiometric analysis of 291 eminent African Americans,2008.0
"A place to be celebrated and understood - The impact of early university entrance from parents' points of view parents; early university entrance This study surveyed 181 parents of students enrolled in one of two early entrance programs at the University of Washington: the Early Entrance Program for students who entered before age 15 and the University of Washington Academy for Young Scholars for students who matriculated after Grade 10. The purpose was to understand parents' perspectives on the early entrance experience, including reasons for choosing early entrance, satisfaction with their children's program, perceived advantages and disadvantages of early entrance, and the effect of early entrance on family relationships. Ninety-five parents participated, with the majority reporting great satisfaction with multiple aspects of their and their children's experience. Early Entrance Program parents expressed a slightly higher degree of satisfaction than did Academy parents.

"Snowflakes, living systems, and the mystery of giftedness talent; intelligence; creativity; nature-nurture; domain and context specificity; state versus trait; dynamic systems and organized complexity; Systems I and 2 cognitive representations and processes The main argument of this article is that human living systems are open, dynamic, intentional systems and, therefore, are capable of building ever more complex behaviors through self-organization and self-direction. This principle underlying general human development is also applicable to the development of gifted and talented behaviors. These behaviors are dynamic because persons demonstrating such behaviors are forming dynamic, functional relations with a specific environment, with unique temporal trajectories capable of engendering emergent properties that feed into further development. This Contextual, Emergent, and Dynamic Model provides an alternative to traditional static, reductionistic, trait-based conceptions of giftedness. The article further elaborates on three dynamic facets of the making of gifted potential: selective affinity, maximal grip, and being at the edge of chaos. These facets allow for dealing with the genesis of talents, developing expertise over an extended period, and developing creative potential.",314.0,"Snowflakes, living systems, and the mystery of giftedness",2008.0
"A national view of promising programs and practices for culturally, linguistically, and ethnically diverse gifted and talented students diversity; front-loading; identification; gifted services; talent development The low representation of culturally, linguistically, and ethnically diverse (CLED) and high-poverty students in gifted and talented programs has long been an area of concern. This qualitative study investigated methods to increase successful participation of CLED students in gifted programs across the nation. Twenty-five programs were selected for inclusion in the study. Of those, 7 programs were selected for in-depth site visits that included interviews with administrators and teachers, as well as observations. Data suggested five categories that contributed to the successful identification and participation of CLED students in gifted programs. These categories included modified identification procedures; program support systems, such as front-loading (identifying high-potential children and providing opportunities for advanced work prior to formal identification); selecting curriculum/instructional designs that enable CLED students to succeed; building parent/home connections; and using program evaluation practices designed to highlight avenues to CLED students' success.",315.0,"A national view of promising programs and practices for culturally, linguistically, and ethnically diverse gifted and talented students",2008.0
"Gender differences in gifted and average-ability students - Comparing girls' and boys' achievement, self-concept, interest, and motivation in mathematics mathematics; giftedness; gender differences; academic self-concept; interest; motivation This article investigates gender differences in 181 gifted and 181 average-ability sixth graders in achievement, academic self-concept, interest, and motivation in mathematics. Giftedness was conceptualized as nonverbal reasoning ability and defined by a rank of at least 95% on a nonverbal reasoning subscale of the German Cognitive Abilities Test. Mathematical achievement was measured by teacher-assigned grades and a standardized mathematics test. Self-concept, interest, and motivation were assessed by questionnaire. In both ability groups, boys earned significantly higher test scores but there were no gender differences in grades. Girls scored lower on measures of academic self-concept, interest, and motivation. Gender differences were larger in gifted than in average-ability students. Ability group differences for self-concept and interest were only found for boys in favor of the gifted. Results support the assumption that gender differences in self-concept, interest, and motivation in mathematics are more prevalent in gifted than in average-ability students.",316.0,"Gender differences in gifted and average-ability students - Comparing girls' and boys' achievement, self-concept, interest, and motivation in mathematics",2008.0

Thirty-two Head Start and state-funded Pre-K children completed the Torrance creativity test Thinking Creatively in Action and Movement (TCAM). The children's private speech was collected in an open play context and while children completed structured logical-mathematical activities. Results revealed that both originality and fluency creativity were related to self-direction private speech and grand total private speech.

Based on the associations among perceived intelligence scores, three dimensions could be distinguished to describe giftedness and could be interpreted as global giftedness, socioemotional giftedness, and artistic giftedness. Using profiles of perceived intelligences, students could be classified as falling into four clusters of supersmart students, socioemotionally gifted students, modest gifted students, and artistically gifted students. The supersmart students engaged in more activities related to leadership and creativity than the other clusters of students, with the modest gifted students reporting the least engagement. The supersmart students, however, were rated by teachers as less emotionally mature, showing less concern for others, and more likely to have behavioral conduct problems than the socioemotionally gifted students.
