"Mindset Misconception? Comparing Mindsets, Perfectionism, and Attitudes of Achievement in Gifted, Advanced, and Typical Students gifted; mindset; perfectionism; achievement attitudes; achievement motivation; implicit theories of intelligence; conceptions of ability The study compared mindset beliefs, perfectionism, and achievement attitudes among gifted, advanced, and typical students in Grades 6 to 8 (N = 416) and explored the relationship between these variables. Welch's F tests revealed no statistically significant difference in growth or fixed mindset beliefs about intelligence among groups. Gifted and advanced students scored higher on Personal Standards (gifted, d = 0.68; advanced, d = 0.62) and Academic Self-Perception (gifted,d = 0.72; advanced, d = 0.58) compared with typical students. In hierarchical regression models, giftedness was a statistically significant predictor for Concern over Mistakes ( = 0.20) and Personal Standards ( = 0.27); both gifted ( = 0.31) and advanced ( = 0.17) status were statistically significant predictors for Academic Self-Perception. Various models showed a positive association between growth mindset and Positive Strivings Perfectionism and achievement attitudes and a positive association between fixed mindset and Evaluative Concerns Perfectionism. Findings suggest that gifted students are not more vulnerable to develop fixed mindsets.",45.0,"Mindset Misconception?

"Predictors of Success Among High School Students in Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate Programs accelerated curricula; high school students; risk and resiliency factors; student success Research has shown that students in Advanced Placement (AP) classes and International Baccalaureate (IB) programs experience higher levels of stress compared to students in general education classes. Elevated stress can serve as a risk factor for students' academic and mental health problems. Given the documented stress of these students, additional investigations are needed to more fully understand how students experience these curricula and the factors associated with positive student outcomes. Thus, we set out to identify factors associated with success among AP/IB students, with an emphasis on exploring potentially malleable factors that could be targeted with existing or newly developed interventions. Data were collected via self-report measures and school records from 2,379 students (Grades 9-12) enrolled in AP or IB in 20 school programs in one state. We examined the relationships among 34 predictors (e.g., stressors, coping styles, student engagement, family factors, school factors, and demographic features) of success. Success was represented by five outcomes in two domains: mental health (life satisfaction, psychopathology, school burnout) and academic (GPA, AP/IB exam scores). Better outcomes in both domains were associated with higher levels of achievement motivation and cognitive engagement, as well as lower levels of parent-child conflict, stress from major life events, and use of avoidance coping strategies. Higher levels of affective engagement, use of approach coping, and authoritative parenting were robust predictors of positive mental health outcomes and unrelated (in multivariate analyses) to academic outcomes. Findings have implications for subsequent development of intervention efforts targeting factors associated with student success.",46.0,Predictors of Success Among High School Students in Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate Programs,2018.0
"A Call for Open Science in Giftedness Research preregistration; replication; reproducibility; replication crisis; p-hacking; questionable research practices (QRPs); HARKing; open science; open data; open materials; registered report Current practices in study design and data analysis have led to low reproducibility and replicability of findings in fields such as psychology, medicine, biology, and economics. Because gifted education research relies on the same underlying statistical and sociological paradigms, it is likely that it too suffers from these problems. This article discusses the origin of the poor replicability and introduces a set of open science practices that can increase the rigor and trustworthiness of gifted education's scientific findings: preregistration, open data and open materials, registered reports, and preprints. Readers are directed to Internet resources for facilitating open science. To model these practices, a pre peer-review preprint of this article is available at https://psyarxiv.com/nhuv3/.",47.0,A Call for Open Science in Giftedness Research,2018.0
"Structured Observation Instruments Assessing Instructional Practices With Gifted and Talented Students: A Review of the Literature evaluation; differentiation; professional development; teacher preparation Teaching and learning are part of a complex interaction between teachers and students. Educational leaders cannot improve the teaching and learning process without quality measurement of effective teaching. One way to capture this complex interaction is by using structured observations. However, the extant literature on classroom observation instruments in the field of gifted education is limited. For that reason, a systematic search was undertaken to identify the observation instruments for assessing instructional practices used with gifted and talented students. In this article, eight observation instruments were identified: (a) Rating Scale of Significant Behaviors in Teachers of the Gifted, (b) Kulieke's adaptation of the Rating Scale of Significant Behaviors in Teachers of the Gifted, (c) Teaching Observation Form (TOF; also known as Purdue Observation Form), (d) Classroom Practices Record (CPR), (e) Classroom Practices Record-Form VA (CPR-Form VA), (f) Classroom Instructional Practices Scale (CIPS), (g) Classroom Observation Scales-Revised (COS-R), and (h) Differentiated Classroom Observation Scale (DCOS). The instruments are described in terms of developmental process, purpose, and any reliability and validity evidence reported. This systematic search has shown the need for a new observation instrument that is comprehensive and closely tied to professional standards.",48.0,Structured Observation Instruments Assessing Instructional Practices With Gifted and Talented Students: A Review of the Literature,2018.0
"Nothing Fits Exactly: Experiences of Asian American Parents of Twice-Exceptional Children high ability; gifted; disability; twice-exceptional; culturally diverse families; Asian American parents; parents Parents of high-ability students with disabilities (i.e., twice-exceptional) play a crucial role in their children's home and educational environments. In addition, parents' sociocultural contexts, including race and ethnicity, can influence their parenting practice. We conducted interviews with 10 Asian American parents from diverse ethnic backgrounds and analyzed the interview transcripts by using a phenomenological framework and general inductive approach. Themes identified included the parents' recognition of and reaction to twice-exceptionality, challenges and efforts in supporting their children, and perception of their sociocultural contexts in relation to parenting practices. The Asian American parents in this study developed resilient parenting styles and persistent advocacy efforts as they navigated the complex characteristics of twice-exceptionality within their multilayered cultural contexts. Findings are particularly important for practitioners and educators who work with Asian American parents and/or high-ability children with disabilities to better address their complex needs.",49.0,Nothing Fits Exactly: Experiences of Asian American Parents of Twice-Exceptional Children,2018.0
"Comparing Metacognition Assessments of Mathematics in Academically Talented Students Junior Metacognition Awareness Inventory; mathematics achievement; metacognition; problem solving; scale development Two studies were conducted to examine and compare the construct validity of scores on the Junior Metacognition Awareness Inventory (JMAI) and problem-solving interview protocols. Participants consisted of 183 middle and high school students attending a university summer program for academically talented youth. Study 1 results indicated that JMAI scores were internally consistent and yielded an interpretable two-factor structure after the elimination of several items; however, the scores were not significantly or meaningfully related to GPA or current and future mathematics achievement. In Study 2 (n = 30), JMAI scores did not predict students' metacognitive behaviors during mathematics problem-solving tasks. In contrast, students' metacognitive behaviors observed during problem solving were meaningfully related to mathematics achievement with medium to high effect sizes. Findings support the predictive validity of metacognition with regard to academic achievement when operationalized with problem-solving interviews, but call into question the criterion-related validity of JMAI scores.",50.0,Comparing Metacognition Assessments of Mathematics in Academically Talented Students,2018.0
"Environmental Perceptions of Gifted Secondary School Students Engaged in an Evidence-Based Enrichment Practice gifted secondary school students; environmental perceptions; enrichment; Type III enrichment Grounded in the Achievement Orientation Model, this qualitative case study examines participation in enrichment and environmental perceptions of gifted secondary school students. Participants included 10 gifted secondary school students, their parents, and their classroom teacher. Data included student, parent, and teacher responses in semistructured interviews, short answer surveys, and student work. Findings indicated a relationship between participation in enrichment and environmental perceptions. Student participants benefited from a teacher trained in gifted education who nurtured both affective and cognitive development, homogeneous grouping with like-minded peers, involved parents, and relationships with project mentors. These findings have implications for designing learning environments that effectively support the special needs of gifted secondary school learners.",51.0,Environmental Perceptions of Gifted Secondary School Students Engaged in an Evidence-Based Enrichment Practice,2018.0

"Using the Cognitive Abilities Test (CogAT) 7 Nonverbal Battery to Identify the Gifted/Talented: An Investigation of Demographic Effects and Norming Plans Cognitive Abilities Test; identification; nonverbal; school-level norming; group-specific norming; opportunity to learn The nonverbal battery of the Cognitive Abilities Test (CogAT) is one of the two most common nonverbal measures used in gifted identification, yet the relationships between demographic variables and CogAT7 performance has not yet been fully examined. Additionally, the effect of using the CogAT7 nonverbal battery on the identification of diverse demographic groups based on various norming, cutoff, and modifier plans has only just begun to be explored. In this study, we analyzed the CogAT7 nonverbal battery scores of kindergartners from a very large urban school district with a high minority, low socioeconomic status, and high English language learner population to determine the relationships between demographic variables and CogAT performance. The results suggest relationships between CogAT scores and multiple demographic variables, similar to other nonverbal instruments. We also examined the effects of various norming practices, including school-level and group-specific norming, on identification using the CogAT7 nonverbal battery.",53.0,Using the Cognitive Abilities Test (CogAT) 7 Nonverbal Battery to Identify the Gifted/Talented: An Investigation of Demographic Effects and Norming Plans,2018.0
"A Meta-Analysis of Gifted and Talented Identification Practices gifted; identification; equitability; testing; underrepresentation; Black; Hispanic; Native American Researchers consider the underrepresentation of Black, Hispanic, and Native American students is largely due to the use of traditional methods of identification (i.e., IQ and standardized achievement tests). To address this concern, researchers created novel nontraditional identification methods (e.g., nonverbal tests, student portfolios, affective checklists). This meta-analysis of 54 studies, consisting of 85 effect sizes representing 191,287,563 students, provides evidence that nontraditional identification methods, while able to narrow the proportional identification gap between underrepresented (Black, Hispanic, and Native American) and represented (Asian and White American) populations, are still unable to address the issue of education inequity. An overall risk ratio of 0.34 was calculated for nontraditional methods of identification in comparison with a 0.27 risk ratio for traditional methods. While the nontraditional methods help identify more underrepresented students as gifted, the results of this meta-analysis show that better identification methods are needed to address inequities in identification.",54.0,A Meta-Analysis of Gifted and Talented Identification Practices,2018.0
"The Identification of Students Who Are Gifted and Have a Learning Disability: A Comparison of Different Diagnostic Criteria twice-exceptional; identification; assessment; cognitive abilities; learning disability Students who are gifted and have a learning disability (GLD) may not be identified, in part because of disagreement regarding appropriate identification criteria. In this study, suggested GLD identification criteria were applied to a nationally representative sample of school-age students to determine the number and characteristics of students identified by each set of GLD criteria. Many but not all students identified as potentially GLD had relative weaknesses in lower order processing abilities and achievement, as hypothesized for this population. Students also exhibited academic strengths, which suggests dual differentiation would be appropriate. Commonly used intraindividual discrepancy criteria identified most potentially gifted students as potentially learning disabled; therefore, these are not valid stand-alone criteria to identify learning disabilities in gifted youth. Results suggest it may be best to combine alternative gifted criteria, an intraindividual LD criterion, and examination of absolute deficits in processing and achievement. Additional implications for research and practice are discussed.",55.0,The Identification of Students Who Are Gifted and Have a Learning Disability: A Comparison of Different Diagnostic Criteria,2018.0
"Making the Cut in Gifted Selection: Score Combination Rules and Their Impact on Program Diversity Identification; assessment; cut-scores; diversity The recommendation of using multiple measures is common in policy guidelines for gifted and talented assessment systems. However, the integration of multiple test scores in a system that uses cut-scores requires choosing between different methods of combining quantitative scores. Past research has indicated that OR combination rules (where any one score must meet the cutoff) have been shown to identify the largest number of students compared with AND (where all scores must meet cutoff) and AVERAGE (where the numerical average is used) rules. We extended this work to a real data set (Grades K to 5 from the CogAT 7 national standardization data) and found that the different combination rules led to differences in the number and diversity of students identified. However, we found these diversity differences were due mainly to the identified pool size and not to the effects of the particular combination rule. This has important implications for practice.",56.0,Making the Cut in Gifted Selection: Score Combination Rules and Their Impact on Program Diversity,2018.0
"ASD Screening Measures for High-Ability Youth With ASD: Examining the ASSQ and SRS ASSQ; SRS; twice-exceptional; intellectual giftedness; autism spectrum disorder High-ability youth diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) historically have been neglected within samples validating ASD screening measures, and consensus for what constitutes high ability has not been established. The Autism Spectrum Screening Questionnaire (ASSQ) and Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) are two common screening tools for ASD used within research and practice settings. We investigated the accuracy of the ASSQ and SRS for ASD identification among a sample of 23 high-ability youth previously diagnosed with ASD. Results suggest both ASSQ and SRS measures inconsistently screened for ASD. The high-ability students with ASD scored significantly lower on the SRS total score and social cognition, communication, and motivation subscales, suggesting potential phenotypic differences among high-ability youth with ASD that could inform assessment and intervention strategies.",57.0,ASD Screening Measures for High-Ability Youth With ASD: Examining the ASSQ and SRS,2018.0
"Linking Teacher and Parent Ratings of Teacher-Nominated Gifted Elementary School Students to Each Other and to School Grades teacher ratings; parent ratings; accuracy; halo effects; relations between teacher and parent ratings; connecting ratings to school grades This study investigated teacher and parent ratings of teacher-nominated gifted elementary school students' verbal abilities, mathematical abilities, deductive reasoning, creative thinking, and engagement, and connected these ratings to school grades. Teacher and parent ratings were compared with regard to accuracy levels and halo effects. Furthermore, this study explored the correlations between teacher and parent ratings and how they are related to school grades. The study was based on data from 572 elementary school students participating in an enrichment program. The results indicated the same accuracy levels for teachers and parents. However, teacher ratings were more strongly affected by halo effects than parent ratings. The correlations between teacher and parent ratings were small to medium. Both raters' ratings were independently and positively associated with German grades when controlling for each other. Positive teacher or parent ratings of mathematical abilities and engagement buffered the relation between the other rater's ratings and math grades.",58.0,Linking Teacher and Parent Ratings of Teacher-Nominated Gifted Elementary School Students to Each Other and to School Grades,2018.0

Three themes were identified through the qualitative analysis: Constraining Environments, Integration versus Isolation, and Resource Plenty versus Resource Poor. Students in both groups experienced environments not conducive to learning, inhibiting peers, and teachers as a barrier. Students in the low-income group described mayhem in their schools, which interfered significantly with learning. These students were highly integrated in their school community, whereas the students in the high-income group were socially isolated from both peers and teachers. Both groups exhibited issues of poor fit within their schools: autonomy and competence for both, relatedness for students in the high-income group. Attention to these issues will help support these students in achieving their potential.",61.0,A Comparison of Perceptions of Barriers to Academic Success Among High-Ability Students From High- and Low-Income Groups: Exposing Poverty of a Different Kind,2018.0

"Disentangling the Roles of Institutional and Individual Poverty in the Identification of Gifted Students hierarchical linear modeling; quantitative methodologies; identification; elementary; age; developmental stage; low income; special populations; underserved gifted Although the relationships between family income and student identification for gifted programming are well documented, less is known about how school and district wealth are related to student identification. To examine the effects of institutional and individual poverty on student identification, we conducted a series of three-level regression models. Students of poverty are generally less likely to be identified for gifted services, even after controlling for prior math and reading achievement. Furthermore, school poverty predicts the percentage of gifted students identified in a school. Within districts, even after controlling for reading and math scores, the poorer schools in a district have lower identification rates. Whereas students of poverty are generally less likely to be identified for gifted services, poor students in poor schools are even less likely to be identified as gifted.",63.0,Disentangling the Roles of Institutional and Individual Poverty in the Identification of Gifted Students,2018.0

Specifically, the authors explored the following questions: (a) What are the characteristics of studies published that explore the intersection of giftedness, poverty, and students of color? (b) How do scholars discuss and theorize about how to recruit and retain gifted students of color who come from families living in poverty? (c) In what ways do scholars discuss the intersection of race and poverty for gifted students of color? Findings indicated that while studies were focused on students of color, there was limited discussion about the impact of race and poverty on the recruitment and retention of gifted students of color who come from families living in poverty.

"Closing Poverty-Based Excellence Gaps: Conceptual, Measurement, and Educational Issues identification; assessment; policy; policy analysis; programming; service delivery models; low income; special populations; underserved gifted; teacher preparation; induction The number of economically vulnerable students in the United States is large and growing. In this article, we examine income-based excellence gaps and describe recent controversies in the definition and measurement of poverty, with an eye toward their application to gifted education and meeting the needs of talented, economically vulnerable students. Regardless of how poverty is conceptualized, evidence suggests that U.S. childhood poverty rates are indeed high, both in absolute terms and relative to other countries, and that income-related achievement disparities are similarly large. Recommendations are included for interventions to close persistent poverty excellence gaps, including frontloading, broadened understanding of opportunity, universal screening using local norms, improved educator preparation and support, state K-12 accountability systems that reward schools for closing excellence gaps, widespread use of ability grouping, and selective use of psychosocial interventions at the college level.",65.0,"Closing Poverty-Based Excellence Gaps: Conceptual, Measurement, and Educational Issues",2018.0

"Early Opportunities to Strengthen Academic Readiness: Effects of Summer Learning on Mathematics Achievement hierarchical linear modeling; quantitative methodologies; mathematics; curriculum; early childhood; age; developmental stage; low income; special populations; underserved gifted Students who come from low-income backgrounds tend to be underidentified and underserved in gifted education. Early interventions with learners of high potential from underserved groups, including exposure to challenging curriculum and summer opportunities, are important for nurturing these students' talents and preparing them for advanced learning opportunities in later school years. Project SPARK, based on the Young Scholars model, focuses on recognizing and responding to high-potential learners from underserved populations in the early grades. In this study, we examined the effects on mathematics achievement of participation in a summer program as part of Project SPARK in schools with substantial populations of students in poverty, as demonstrated by percentage of students eligible for free or reduced lunch. We examined summer program effects on achievement for the sample overall and specifically for students from low-income backgrounds. Students who participated in the summer program made moderately larger mathematics achievement gains than students who did not participate, with Cohen's d-type effect sizes of 0.92. Students who qualified for free or reduced lunch saw similar gains over the summer if they participated in the summer program, indicating that the summer program experience was supportive for students across a range of income backgrounds.",67.0,Early Opportunities to Strengthen Academic Readiness: Effects of Summer Learning on Mathematics Achievement,2018.0

Student outcome measures included science content achievement, engineering knowledge, and engineering engagement. The sample comprised 1,387 Grade 1 students across 62 classrooms. Multilevel modeling was used separately for each of the three student outcome measures. The intervention resulted in an effect size of 0.28 on an out-of-level science content assessment and effect size of 0.66 for the engineering knowledge measure. Students in the intervention group reported a high level of engineering engagement. General education teachers were trained to implement the curricula through a summer institute and received coaching throughout the subsequent academic year. Evidence suggests the intervention functioned as a talent-spotting tool as teachers reported they would nominate a substantial portion of low-income and culturally diverse students for subsequent gifted and talented services. Discussion focused on the match between the needs and preferences of students from low-income households for hands-on design experiences and the curricular affordances in the engineering domain as a talent development pathway for young, poor children.",69.0,A Talent for Tinkering: Developing Talents in Children From Low-Income Households Through Engineering Curriculum,2018.0
