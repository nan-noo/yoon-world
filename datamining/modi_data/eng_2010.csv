"Parental Influences on the Academic Motivation of Gifted Students: A Self-Determination Theory Perspective self-determination theory; parenting; motivation; gifted children; United States The home environment that parents provide their gifted children can have a significant impact on academic motivation, yet limited research has focused on this topic. Self-determination theory, a comprehensive framework of motivation, was used in the current study to explore two research questions: (a) What attitudes do parents of gifted students have toward the academic motivation of their children? (b) What approaches do parents of gifted students use at home to develop academic motivation? Interviews with 30 parents of gifted children from across the United States revealed three higher order themes including Parents as Experts, Scaffolding, and Behavior Modification. From a self-determination theory perspective, results suggest that despite good intentions, the parents of this study were inconsistent in providing home environments that support their children's development of internalized forms of academic motivation.",238.0,Parental Influences on the Academic Motivation of Gifted Students: A Self-Determination Theory Perspective,2010.0
"Correlates of Teacher Practices Influencing Student Outcomes in Reading Instruction for Advanced Readers advanced readers; teacher practices; student outcomes In a professional development project, six teaching practices were posited as necessary for improving affective and cognitive outcomes for identified advanced readers. These practices were identification, organization for instruction, content, instructional strategies, continuous improvement assessment, and ambassadorship. Sixty-one teachers received training in these practices and were evaluated on their implementation, with usable data from 37. Implementation ratings were correlated with measure of reading attitude and literary analysis. Several correlations were discovered that have implications for understanding teaching style and the influence of teacher practice on student outcomes.",239.0,Correlates of Teacher Practices Influencing Student Outcomes in Reading Instruction for Advanced Readers,2010.0
"Examining the Probability of Identification for Gifted Programs for Students in Georgia Elementary Schools: A Multilevel Path Analysis Study Identification; underrepresentation; race; multilevel; structural equation modeling This study focused on the analysis of a large-scale data set (N = 326,352) collected by the Georgia Department of Education using multilevel path analysis to model the probability that a student would be identified for participation in a gifted program. The model examined individual- and school-level factors that influence the probability that an individual would be identified. The probability of being identified as gifted depended strongly on student race and socioeconomic status and varied strongly across schools.",240.0,Examining the Probability of Identification for Gifted Programs for Students in Georgia Elementary Schools: A Multilevel Path Analysis Study,2010.0
"Multigroup Construct Validity Evidence of the HOPE Scale: Instrumentation to Identify Low-Income Elementary Students for Gifted Programs factor analysis; quantitative methodologies; identification; assessment; low income; special populations/undeserved gifted; teacher nominations Students with exceptional academic potential who come from low-income families are frequently not identified for and consequently are underrepresented in gifted and talented programs. Because of this, new means of identifying such children must be developed. This article presents the findings of exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses conducted on the HOPE Scale, a 13-item teacher-rating instrument designed to identify academic and social components of giftedness in elementary-aged students. Participants included 349 teachers who completed HOPE Scales on 5,995 ethnically and economically diverse students from three rural and two metropolitan school districts in the Midwest. Multigroup confirmatory factor analysis was also used to evaluate measurement invariance between income groups. Findings suggest a two-factor model represents good fit for the data while remaining loyal to the latent constructs of academic and social giftedness. Although showing some legitimate mean differences, invariance test results suggested equivalence of model form, factor loading, and factor variances across income groups.",241.0,Multigroup Construct Validity Evidence of the HOPE Scale: Instrumentation to Identify Low-Income Elementary Students for Gifted Programs,2010.0
"Modeling Outcomes With Floor or Ceiling Effects: An Introduction to the Tobit Model Tobit; ceiling effect; regression; quantitative methods; statistics In gifted education research, it is common for outcome variables to exhibit strong floor or ceiling effects due to insufficient range of measurement of many instruments when used with gifted populations. Common statistical methods (e. g., analysis of variance, linear regression) produce biased estimates when such effects are present. In practice, it is frequent for researchers to ignore ceiling effects and proceed with traditional analysis. However, the problems caused by ceiling effects are not without possible solutions. This Methodological Brief describes a variation of multiple regression, called the Tobit model, which is capable of correct inference when floor or ceiling effects are present. A brief simulation study illustrates the performance of the Tobit model with a dataset exhibiting a ceiling effect.",242.0,Modeling Outcomes With Floor or Ceiling Effects: An Introduction to the Tobit Model,2010.0
"Putting Standards Into Practice: Evaluating the Utility of the NAGC Pre-K-Grade 12 Gifted Program Standards NAGC Pre-K-Grade 12 Gifted Program Standards; identification; evaluation; special populations/underserved gifted; professional development Despite their importance, there has been surprisingly little scholarly examination of the NAGC Pre-K-Grade 12 Gifted Program Standards (NAGC, 2008/2000; Landrum, Callahan, & Shaklee, 2001) since their publication a decade ago. As part of a larger study investigating the effectiveness of local policies developed within the framework of state law, we used a qualitative approach to examine the 'minimum' and 'exemplary' criteria from the Student Identification portion of these NAGC Standards. Through this process we developed a 27-item checklist, which we then used to evaluate 43 locally developed plans for identifying diverse gifted learners from one large state in the southeastern United States. Based on this experience, we identify the strengths and weaknesses that we encountered in using the Standards for this purpose. We provide the checklist items we developed, and we offer specific suggestions for how the Gifted Program Standards in their currently ongoing revision process might be made more user-friendly for practitioners to apply toward effective evaluation of gifted program documents.",243.0,Putting Standards Into Practice: Evaluating the Utility of the NAGC Pre-K-Grade 12 Gifted Program Standards,2010.0
"School Counselors' Perceptions and Experience With Acceleration as a Program Option for Gifted and Talented Students acceleration; social and/or emotional development and adjustment; counseling; training and preparation This article presents findings from a national survey of 149 practicing school counselors who are members of the American School Counselor Association. The survey gathered information on school counselors' perceptions of and experiences with acceleration as a program option for gifted students. Results indicate that, although school counselors' opinions are being solicited in decision making regarding acceleration, they do not possess training and accurate information regarding acceleration. Hence, training and professional development focusing on the research-based practices of acceleration are needed to ensure that school counselors give accurate advice and guidance concerning gifted students' education. Future research is needed to compare and contrast the effectiveness of accelerative decision making between school counselors who are trained and untrained in acceleration programmatic options.",244.0,School Counselors' Perceptions and Experience With Acceleration as a Program Option for Gifted and Talented Students,2010.0
"The Teacher Observation Form: Revisions and Updates instrumentation; teacher observation; program evaluation; gifted education; teacher practices This article discusses the original development and subsequent updates and revisions made to the Teacher Observation Form (TOF). The TOF is a 12-item form to be used by evaluators in the observation of teachers of gifted and talented students. After nearly 25 years of use, the original TOF was revised based on input from content experts and modified to reflect current effective standards of practices in gifted education. The revised TOF was then used on 217 occasions over a 2-year period to evaluate teachers in university-based enrichment programs. Results indicated that alpha reliability estimates increased for 9 of the 12 TOF items and that the overall rater-level effect (intraclass correlation coefficient) was comparable with that of classroom-level effects in standardized test scores. Based on these findings the authors offer the TOF as a means to provide feedback to teachers as to the prevalence of gifted education pedagogical effective practices in their classrooms.",245.0,The Teacher Observation Form: Revisions and Updates,2010.0
"The Efficacy of Academic Acceleration for Gifted Minority Students academic acceleration; gifted minority students; Project EXCITE; peer pressure This study supported the use of acceleration for gifted minority students in math. The gifted minority students in this study viewed taking accelerated math courses as exciting and beneficial for preparation for high school and college and particularly liked the challenges they encountered while taking advanced classes. They enjoyed working ahead and having a leg up in school and were infused with a special feeling of being gifted and talented in taking accelerated math. Ethnicity was not a major factor for teachers' support for acceleration. The teachers believed that acceleration provides necessary challenges for students, makes them committed to schoolwork, and enhances their academic achievement. No negative peer pressure resulting from academic acceleration was found, though the teachers were more certain than the students about the existence of negative peer culture for gifted minority students.",246.0,The Efficacy of Academic Acceleration for Gifted Minority Students,2010.0
"Preservice Teachers' Perceptions and Experiences in a Gifted Education Training Model preservice; preservice training; gifted training; practicum With the prevalence of gifted students in general education classrooms, all teachers will be responsible for providing appropriate programming for them, resulting in a need for training in the education of the gifted to be introduced at the preservice level. In this study, the researchers investigated the effectiveness of a combined intervention strategy for preservice teachers, consisting of a course in the education of the gifted and an accompanying 9-week practicum, in increasing participants' understanding of the characteristics and needs of gifted students. Through semistructured interviews, participants' perceptions of the effects the interventions had on their understanding of gifted students' characteristics and needs were examined. The findings from the interviews were triangulated with classroom observations, lesson plans, and participant responses to the Survey of Practices with Students of Varying Needs. Participants perceived an increase in their understanding of the needs and characteristics of gifted students through participation in the interventions as well as increased confidence in their general teaching abilities. Implications of the study for teacher education and future research are discussed.",247.0,Preservice Teachers' Perceptions and Experiences in a Gifted Education Training Model,2010.0
"Career Decision Making Among Gifted Students: The Mediation of Teachers gifted students; career orientations; teacher influences; school experiences; science education; mathematics education; humanities education There is international concern about falling enrollments in higher education, particularly the sciences, by gifted students. In this mixed methods study, the top-performing 200 students (approximately 2%) within a particular education jurisdiction at the beginning of their first year at university were surveyed, and 20 interviewed about their school experiences using a biographical interpretive design. This study focused on identifying those characteristics of teachers that supported students' interests. Participants identified seven characteristics of teachers that students identified as supportive of their potential career pathways. These included connecting pedagogical practices with student interests, being passionate about their subject matter, having good content knowledge, making learning experiences relevant, setting high expectations of students, being a good explainer of complex ideas, and being a good classroom manager. This study extends our knowledge of how teachers influence gifted students and has implications for both preservice and in-service teacher education and career counseling.",248.0,Career Decision Making Among Gifted Students: The Mediation of Teachers,2010.0
"A Progressive Pedagogy for Online Learning With High-Ability Secondary School Students: A Case Study online pedagogy; online technologies; international case study; high-ability students This article describes a case study of a group of ten 14-year-old students who engaged with an online extended-learning project as an extracurricular activity for about 6 months. The students were physically located in Australia, Malaysia, and the United Kingdom. The facilitation and online learning made use of a progressive pedagogy that moved from structured, whole group online participation to a more individual, open approach to learning. The study investigated students' motivation to participate in the online learning and explored the nature of the interactions in an online learning environment. The findings show that students interacted differently online, depending on the task at hand. Seven of the 10 students completed the final task of creating learning products. The implications of the study for online learning with high-ability school students are discussed.",249.0,A Progressive Pedagogy for Online Learning With High-Ability Secondary School Students: A Case Study,2010.0
"Dealing With Dependence (Part II): A Gentle Introduction to Hierarchical Linear Modeling clustered data; hierarchical linear modeling; gifted education research In education, most naturally occurring data are clustered within contexts. Students are clustered within classrooms, classrooms are clustered within schools, and schools are clustered within districts. When people are clustered within naturally occurring organizational units such as schools, classrooms, or districts, the responses of people from the same cluster are likely to exhibit some degree of relatedness with each other. The use of hierarchical linear modeling allows researchers to adjust for and model this non-independence. Furthermore, it may be of great substantive interest to try to understand the degree to which people from the same cluster are similar to each other and then to try to identify variables that help us to understand differences both within and across clusters. In HLM, we endeavor to understand and explain between-and within-cluster variability of an outcome variable of interest. We can also use predictors at both the individual level (level 1), and the contextual level (level 2) to explain the variance in the dependent variable. This article presents a simple example using a real data set and walk through the interpretation of a simple hierarchical linear model to illustrate the utility of the technique.",250.0,Dealing With Dependence (Part II): A Gentle Introduction to Hierarchical Linear Modeling,2010.0
"Socioeconomic Status Effects on Using the Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test (NNAT) to Identify the Gifted/Talented identification; socioeconomic status; Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test The Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test (NNAT) is said to be a culturally neutral measure of ability that assesses both majority and minority students equally. Although research has examined the effects of ethnicity and gender on NNAT performance, little published research has examined the relationship between socioeconomic status (SES) and NNAT performance. Correlations and multiple regression were used to examine the relationships between ethnicity, SES, and NNAT performance in a large kindergarten sample. The results suggest a significant relationship between ethnicity, SES, and NNAT performance. Even after adjusting for ethnic differences, children from low-SES families were half as likely as other children to be identified.",251.0,Socioeconomic Status Effects on Using the Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test (NNAT) to Identify the Gifted/Talented,2010.0
"Developmental Changes in Processing Speed: Influence of Accelerated Education for Gifted Children gifted children; speed of information processing (SIP); accelerated education; development There are two major hypotheses concerning the developmental trends of processing speeds. These hypotheses explore both local and global trends. The study presented here investigates the effects of people's different knowledge on the speed with which they are able to process information. The participants in this study are gifted children aged 9, 11, and 13 years. A total of 94 of the participants were members of gifted programs, whereas the other 93 children received standard education. They were required to finish two information-processing tasks: a Choice Reaction Time task and an Abstract Matching task. The results show that the reaction time of gifted children who received accelerated education in gifted programs was significantly faster than that of the children who received standard education at every age. These results seem to imply that the educational atmosphere in which a child is placed plays a significant role in the development of gifted children's speed of information processing.",252.0,Developmental Changes in Processing Speed: Influence of Accelerated Education for Gifted Children,2010.0
"Exploring the Relationship of College Freshmen Honors Students' Effort and Ability Attribution, Interest, and Implicit Theory of Intelligence With Perceived Ability interest; achievement; ability; effort; implicit theory of intelligence Although there are several explanations for why one succeeds or fails, effort and ability are the major causes that students report. The purpose of the present study was to measure the perceptions of 149 college freshmen enrolled in a university honors program about their skills in 15 talent areas. In addition, this study explored the relationship of interests and ability and effort attributions with self-efficacy and investigated gender differences in these perceptions. There was a positive relationship between students' interest in a talent area and their assessment of their skill in that area. The strongest relationships tended to be in nonacademic areas. For some talents, males placed stronger attributions on the role that natural ability played, whereas females indicated that personal effort contributed to high levels of performance. Participants' implicit theory of intelligence did not appear to influence their perceptions of the importance of ability in academic performance.",253.0,"Exploring the Relationship of College Freshmen Honors Students' Effort and Ability Attribution, Interest, and Implicit Theory of Intelligence With Perceived Ability",2010.0
"Cognitive and Psychosocial Characteristics of Gifted Students With Written Language Disability gifted students; disorder of written expression; specific learning disabilities Gifted and talented students who also have a specific learning disability (SLD) are typically referred to as twice-exceptional and are among the most underserved students in our schools. Previous special education laws promoted a wait-to-fail approach; therefore, gifted students with SLD often were overlooked because their average academic performance was not failure enough. The flip side to this was the fact that students' giftedness, as measured by general ability tests, often was masked by average, yet relatively weak, academic achievement. They were not only waiting to fail, they were failing to flourish. The authors present the data gathered from 14 gifted students with SLD, specifically a disorder of written expression. Students were determined to be gifted if they earned a score of 120 (Superior) on the Verbal Scale of a cognitive ability test. They were considered to have a written language disability through an evaluation of their written language skills. The average Verbal IQ for the group was close to a standard score of 130, whereas the average Written Language Score was close to a standard score of 99. In addition to the cognitive profile for these students, the authors obtained measures of their psychosocial functioning. On average, parents, teachers, and students reported typical adaptive behavior, yet group elevations also were present on several clinical scales. The authors' main conclusion is that a comprehensive assessment plays a critical role in (a) determining whether a student is twice-exceptional, (b) identifying the possibility of psychosocial concerns, and (c) developing educational recommendations.",254.0,Cognitive and Psychosocial Characteristics of Gifted Students With Written Language Disability,2010.0
"High Achievement on Advanced Placement Exams: The Relationship of School-Level Contextual Factors to Performance high achievement; Advanced Placement; hierarchical regression The purpose of the study was to identify school- and district-level variables that relate to advanced academic achievement, as defined by the ratio of number of scores of 3, 4, or 5 on Advanced Placement exams to school enrollment. The study initially included 46 variables for 339 public high schools in one Midwestern state. Hierarchical linear regressions were applied to 14 and then 7 independent variables, explaining 80% of the variance in advanced academic achievement among high schools. Findings indicate that after accounting for seemingly fixed factors, schools and districts can still contribute significantly in the development of advanced academic achievement. Implications for educators and policy makers are discussed.",255.0,High Achievement on Advanced Placement Exams: The Relationship of School-Level Contextual Factors to Performance,2010.0
"Strategies Used by Intellectually Gifted Students to Cope With Stress During Their Participation in a High School International Baccalaureate Program qualitative methodologies; social development; emotional development; high school; stress Individuals respond to threats to affiliation and achievement needs through drawing on a repertoire of coping strategies specific to a given situation. Gifted adolescents in college-preparatory high school programs may be faced with novel stressors, and may have unique coping strategies to manage these challenges. The current study considers responses to surveys of stress and coping as well as focus group interviews of gifted and high-achieving students enrolled in an academically intense curriculum, the International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma Program. Findings of this secondary analysis of archival data sets indicate gifted students experience levels of stress similar to their IB classmates not identified as gifted. Additionally, gifted students were similar to IB peers not identified as gifted with respect to how they cope with school; likenesses included positive reframing, time and task management, avoiding tasks, and seeking social support. However, gifted IB students differed from IB classmates with respect to anger coping, humor, and problem-solving approaches.",256.0,Strategies Used by Intellectually Gifted Students to Cope With Stress During Their Participation in a High School International Baccalaureate Program,2010.0
"Tales Gifted Children Tell: Exploring PTAT Responses as Pathways to Socio-Affective Concerns pTAT; gifted; socio-emotional concerns The Philippine Thematic Apperception Test was administered to 22 intellectually superior Filipino children aged 4 to 9 years from private and public school settings as a means to explore their socio-emotional concerns. A grounded analysis of their narratives revealed the following themes: (a) importance of family relationships, (b) perceptions on school and intelligence, (c) predominant characterization of heroes, (d) peer relationships, and (e) concerns related to God and spirituality. Significant differences in the narratives of the public and private school children are also examined.

"Dealing With Dependence (Part I): Understanding the Effects of Clustered Data interclass correlation; clustered data; hierarchical linear modeling; gifted education research This article provides a conceptual introduction to the issues surrounding the analysis of clustered (nested) data. We define the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and the design effect, and we explain their effect on the standard error. When the ICC is greater than 0, then the design effect is greater than 1. In such a scenario, the standard error produced under the assumption of independence is underestimated. This increases the Type I error rate. We provide a short illustration of the effect of non-independence on the standard error. We show that after accounting for the design effect, our decision about the statistical significance of the test statistic changes. When we fail to account for the clustered nature of the data, we conclude that the difference between the two groups is statistically significant. However, once we adjust the standard error for the design effect, the difference is no longer statistically significant.",258.0,Dealing With Dependence (Part I): Understanding the Effects of Clustered Data,2010.0
"Examining the Relationship Between the Overexcitabilities and Self-Concepts of Gifted Adolescents via Multivariate Cluster Analysis self-concept; overexcitabilities; adolescents The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between gifted adolescents' forms of overexcitabilities and self-concepts. Clusters of adolescents were formed on the basis of their overexcitabilities, and these clusters of adolescents were then compared with regard to their self-concept scores. Gender differences were also examined. The sample consisted of 379 gifted adolescents, ranging in age from 11 to 16 years of age. Forms of overexcitabilities were measured using the Overexcitabilities Questionnaire-II, and various facets of self-concept were measured using the Self-Description Questionnaire-II. Using cluster analysis, multivariate analysis of variance, and chi-square analysis, results suggested a distinct four-cluster solution, as well as differences between clusters in self-concept and gender.",259.0,Examining the Relationship Between the Overexcitabilities and Self-Concepts of Gifted Adolescents via Multivariate Cluster Analysis,2010.0
"Developing and Fostering Passion in Academic and Nonacademic Domains creativity; qualitative methodologies; high school; college or adult; social and/or emotional development and adjustment The purpose of this study was to explore how passion was manifested among gifted and talent youth selected from a larger longitudinal study of child and adolescent development. The gifted sample included 25 high school and college students who were selected because they were in a gifted program in elementary school. The talent sample included 41 high school students who were selected because they were highly involved in athletics and the arts in middle childhood. The authors found that passion was more characteristic of participation in nonacademic activities (i.e., sports and the arts). Talented youth were more likely to talk about wanting to do their activity all the time, experiencing flow, getting emotional release from participation, and internalizing the activity into their identity. The authors also found that school settings, and especially regular classrooms as compared with gifted and advanced classes, appeared to undermine rather that support passion. The authors discuss implications of their findings for creating school environments that can foster passion.",260.0,Developing and Fostering Passion in Academic and Nonacademic Domains,2010.0
"Mental Disorders Among Gifted and Nongifted Youth: A Selected Review of the Epidemiologic Literature gifted; mental health; adolescents; depression; anxiety Given the ongoing debate over whether giftedness is associated with mental health disorders, there is a great need to highlight and compare results from the most methodologically rigorous studies. Surprisingly, the vast majority of literature reviews and background sections of research articles include studies that do not directly compare gifted and nongifted youth. Furthermore, almost no attention has been paid to how differences in the definitions of giftedness or mental health outcomes of interest affect the interpretation and comparison of studies. The authors apply an epidemiologic perspective for thinking about these issues, highlight many of the challenges of studying this population, and present results from meta-analyses that include the most methodologically rigorous studies comparing rates of depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety, suicide ideation, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) between gifted and nongifted youth.

However, because there is a lack of structured, standardized, and empirically tested best practices for counseling gifted students, school counselors may not know how best to serve this unique population. The purpose of this study was to investigate gifted and talented adolescents' experiences with the counseling techniques, strategies, and approaches most frequently cited in the gifted education literature in order to determine if any of these best practices were actually occurring. Few of these best practices were experienced by gifted and talented adolescents surveyed.
