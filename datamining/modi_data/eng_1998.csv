"A national study of science curriculum effectiveness with high ability students   This study assessed student growth on integrated science process skills after being taught a 20-36 hour science unit. The prototypical unit, Acid, Acid Everywhere, was implemented in 15 school districts across seven states. Although seven science units for high ability learners have been developed through a federally funded project, the student outcome results only from Acid, Acid Everywhere, the most widely replicated unit, are reported here. All units were based on the Integrated Curriculum Model (ICM) developed specifically for gifted learners; the mode stresses advanced content, high level process and product, and a concept dimension. Results indicate small, but significant, gains for students integrated science process skills when compared to equally able students not using the units. Implementation data reflected satisfaction of teachers with the units, especially in terms of student interest and motivation. The effectiveness of this curriculum, designed to align with the new science standards and to be appropriate for gifted students, lends credibility to the argument for using the new content standards as a basis for curriculum development efforts with gifted learners.",605.0,A national study of science curriculum effectiveness with high ability students,1998.0
"Open-ended activities: Differentiation through learner responses   This article explores the meaning of curricular differentiation for identified gifted students by examining learner responses to open-ended activities. Very little research supports or describes how open-ended activities-which have been advocated as a strategy to allow students to work in their own interest areas, in their own learning styles, and at their own ability level-serve to differentiate the curriculum. This paper sets curriculum differentiation in a historical perspective, reviews a comprehensive investigation into the nature of open-ended activities, and focuses on how and in what ways the responses to open-ended activities of children identified as a gifted differed from responses of children who were not identified as gifted in a third-grade a fourth-grade heterogeneously grouped classroom. The study also focuses on teacher perceptions of classroom activities and learner responses. Data sources included observations over the course of one academic year, interviews with teachers and students, learning style and interest assessment instruments, and documents related to over 33 open-ended activities. Based on the findings reported here, the author proposes a reexamination of the meaning of curricular differentiation with a renewed emphasis on determining how an instructional strategy, for example, providing open-ended activities, maximizes student's capabilities.",606.0,Open-ended activities: Differentiation through learner responses,1998.0
"Gifted education meets Reggio Emilia: Visions for curriculum in gifted education for young children   The purpose of this article is to explore the relationships in curriculum thinking, development, and implementation between gifted education and early childhood education. Young gifted children (ages birth to eight) are among the most underserved populations of gifted children; yet, we know that early intervention has a significant effect on their continued development. In this article, we provide a review of the current curriculum models used in gifted child education and early childhood education, focusing on a comparison of the two. We examine the role of the child in the curriculum making, the voice of the parents, and the responsibilities of the teacher. Finally, we turn our attention to the Reggio Emilia approach to early childhood education as a means to expand our view of curriculum, the importance of the environment, and the crucial need to use the child's needs, interests, and abilities as the initial and sustaining focus of curriculum development.",607.0,Gifted education meets Reggio Emilia: Visions for curriculum in gifted education for young children,1998.0
"For the good of humankind: Matching the budding talent with a curriculum of conscience   For most of this century, educators have debated the types of different curriculum highly able students require in order to realize their contribution to self and society (Gallagher et al., 1969; Marland, 1971; Milne, 1979; Passow, 1958, 1979, 1985; Renzulli, 1982; Tannenbaum, 1979; Tomlinson, 1995; Ward, 1961). Wherein lies the inspiration for the kind of human endeavor that talent development and, ultimately, creative expression engender? This paper traces the rationale for the development and unique talents to the eminent philosopher William James (1902) and suggests a relationship between this highly personal process and the maturity of one's ethos, or ethical world view. Is one element of talent development, ethical behavior, to benefit humankind? If so, what types of curricular opportunities do we need to provide bright, talented children and youth to stretch their current boundaries, to challenge them as they need to be challenged, and to stimulate them to use their creativity productively to make their world a better place?",608.0,For the good of humankind: Matching the budding talent with a curriculum of conscience,1998.0
"From Passow to Gardner: Curriculum for talent development   As one of the early pioneers in gifted education, A. Harry Passow was a strong advocate for curricula that considered the total learning environment as a means of nurturing students' individual gifts and talents. His classic description of four curricula (general, specialized, covert, and nonschool educative) the impact gifted learners is relevant in schools where gifted students may spend the majority of their day in a general education classroom. This article illustrates how Harry Passow's views on curriculum and talent development are similar to those of Howard Gardner and how the author has used both theorists' views to develop a student-centered curriculum planning model. The model has been field-tested in general education classrooms and shows promise for creating a stimulating learning environment to nurture students' talents.",609.0,From Passow to Gardner: Curriculum for talent development,1998.0
"A national curriculum and the sovereignty of higher ability learners   Over the past half-century, the British education system has undergone three major changes in relation to higher ability pupils: an extension of opportunity for very able working class children to attend selective, state-funded grammar schools; a leveling out of opportunities within state-funded schools by abolishing the 11-plus examination, the purpose of which was to select higher ability pupils for grammar school entry; and the introduction of a National Curriculum, imposing statutory curriculum requirements for all state funded schools. The main focus of this paper is on the last of the three and the way in which British teachers perceive how the National Curriculum may have affected educational opportunities and sovereignty of higher ability pupils.",610.0,A national curriculum and the sovereignty of higher ability learners,1998.0

"Dynamic assessment and its use with underserved gifted and talented populations   A relatively close new nontraditional approach to assessing cognitive ability is to instruct students on how to perform on certain tasks and then measure their progress in learning to solve similar problems. This approach, called dynamic assessment, usually consists of a test-intervene-retest format that focuses attention on the improvement in student performance when an adult provides mediated assistance on how to master the testing task. The dynamic assessment approach can provide a means for assessing disadvantaged, disabled, or limited English proficiency students who have not demonstrated high ability on traditional tests of intelligence and creativity. Dynamic assessment methods should be considered by school districts with large numbers of disadvantaged students which are dissatisfied with the effectiveness of traditional methods for identifying students for specialized enrichment programs.",614.0,Dynamic assessment and its use with underserved gifted and talented populations,1998.0
"Family factors associated with high academic competence among former head start children   From a database generated by the multi-site National Head Start/Public School Early Childhood Transition Demonstrated Project, a subsample of the 154 children with the highest academic achievement was drawn from the 5,142 non-handicapped participants from English-speaking homes with relatively complete data collected in Spring of first grade. Their families reported higher educational and income levels and had fewer children, more of the families were Caucasian, children's caretakers less often reported prolonged depression, parenting practices were more responsive and flexible and less restrictive, and the children were seen by parents and teachers as more socially skilled than were the comparison group. Within this low-income group (half reporting monthly incomes of $1000 or less), conditions propitious for child development are demonstrated to be associated with high academic competence.",615.0,Family factors associated with high academic competence among former head start children,1998.0
"Gender-related differences in academically talented students' scores and use of time on tests of spatial ability   Gender-related differences in test scores of spatial ability have been ascribed to a tendency of females to take more time in working on such tasks, which is believed to be to their disadvantage in time-limited tests. This hypothesis was examined in a population of academically talented students who took four subtests on the computer of the Spatial Test Battery of the Institute for the Academic Advancement of Youth. Males had higher scores on three of these tests, females on another test which was a measure of visual memory. Females tended to take more time to work on the tests, even when their scores were higher than those of males, but this difference was substantial only for two of the tests. the time taken to work on the items was positively correlated with the scores on two of the tests. These results indicate that the amount of time taken can neither explain gender-related score differences on spatial tests in general is the habit to use more time necessarily detrimental to test performance. The habit to work quickly or slowly on spatial tests appeared to be a fairly general characteristic. It seems to be different from speed of cognitive processing. When asked to give ratings on their performance on the tests, females tended to estimate their scores more modestly than males, although females, like males, tended to overestimate their performance on two of the measures.",616.0,Gender-related differences in academically talented students' scores and use of time on tests of spatial ability,1998.0
"Building bridges between general practitioners and educators of the gifted: A study of collaboration   The Collaboration Research Study examined the incidence of collaboration, as well as the assumptions of those who entered collaborative alliances. Collaboration was defined as dialogue and planning between professionals in which the goal is to provide differentiated services for high achieving students. Two hundred and eighty-nine enrichment specialists, classroom teachers, and administrators, selected purposefully, took part in this national , descriptive, ex post facto research. The response rate from the three groups was 61%, 55%, and 51%, respectively. Results indicate that more than 80% of those sampled engage in collaboration. Data suggest that classroom teachers and enrichment specialists enter the collaborative relationship with different, and sometimes conflicting, sets of assumptions about the skills and attitudes of their collaborative partners. These empirical findings suggest that collaboration is a complex, interpersonal process. Implications of the study are twofold. First, collaboration depends upon highly developed interpersonal skills. Second, successful collaborative relationships rest upon the match between the assumptions that each party holds about the other. In order to ensure collaborative alliances that can produce high quality, differentiated learning options, the assumptions of each party need to be understood and, if necessary, bridges need to be built when gaps exist between the assumptions and the actual skills and attitudes of collaborative parties.",617.0,Building bridges between general practitioners and educators of the gifted: A study of collaboration,1998.0

"A model for clarification and expansion of conceptual foundations   Practitioners, researchers, and theorists can establish stronger rationale and direction for their work through better understanding of the conceptual foundations that influence the field of education of the gifted. Navigation along three interpretive dimensions can clarify and expand these conceptual foundations, which currently suffer from fragmentation and insularity. One of these dimensions invites movement through several different world views Another dimension invites interdisciplinary movement from the precision of the hard sciences to the uncertain complexity of the soft and human sciences. A third dimension promotes movement through different levels of analysis, ranging from panoramic levels of philosophical and theoretical perspectives to the grounded levels of empirical research and practical application. A three-dimensional model illustrates the dynamics of these movements while highlighting some barriers that cause fragmentation and insularity in conceptual foundations. Recommendations for breaking through these barriers are provided.",621.0,A model for clarification and expansion of conceptual foundations,1998.0
"A proposal for subcategories within gifted or talented populations   Following a survey of the literature and a critique of an earlier proposal by Gagne (1993), the author describes a new system of categories to subdivide the gifted and talented populations into more homogeneous subgroups. Based on the metric system, each of the five levels, including the minimum threshold, selects the top 10% of the previous level; to each subgroup is attributed a qualify label: mild, moderate, high, exceptional, extreme. The author argues for its widespread adoption by professionals in the field of gifted education.",622.0,A proposal for subcategories within gifted or talented populations,1998.0
"Gifted students with attention deficits: Fact and/or fiction? Or, can we see the forest for the trees?   According to Gordon (1990), far too many high ability students are referred for problems with impulsivity, hyperactivity, and sustaining attention. Several important issues, rarely discussed in the literature on attention deficits, offer alternative hypotheses for the increasing incidence of hyper-activity and attention problems of gifted youngsters. These include theories on emotional development and excitability of gifted students (Dabrowski, 1938; Piechowski & Colangelo, 1984), evidence of unchallenging curricula for high ability students (Reif, 1993), implications of the multiple intelligences paradigm (Gardner, 1983), and adult reaction to students' extreme precocity (Rimm, 1994). These issues are examined in light of Barkley's theory of inhibition as it relates to the manifestation of ADHD. The issues represent environmental conditions that may cause or influence ADHD-like behaviors in high ability students. Diagnostic and intervention strategies are suggested to counteract environmental contributors to the problem.",623.0,"Gifted students with attention deficits: Fact and/or fiction?

"Perceived factors influencing the academic underachievement of talented students of Puerto Rican descent   This qualitative investigation explored the self and environmental perceptions of six talented students of Puerto Rican descent who were underachieving in an urban high school in the northeastern section of the United States. Family, school, classroom, community, and personality issues were examined, as were the ways that these experiences contributed to their actual academic status. Participant observation, interviews, document review, and other supplementary techniques were used to gather data. The major findings of this study was that the absence of early appropriate academic experiences thwarted students' possibilities of developing their high abilities or talents later in life. Other interactive factors influencing the students' academic life were also identified. A model explaining the phenomenon of underachievement among the students emerged, as did suggestions for meeting their needs.",624.0,Perceived factors influencing the academic underachievement of talented students of Puerto Rican descent,1998.0
"Curriculum compacting and achievement test scores: What does the research say?   This study examined the effects of curriculum compacting on the achievement test scores of a national sample of 336 high ability students from second through sixth grade heterogeneous classrooms in rural, suburban, and urban settings. Curriculum compacting is a strategy for eliminating curricular material that students have already mastered and replacing it with more appropriate learning activities. Teachers from three treatment and control groups in this experimental study selected one to two students from their classes who demonstrated superior ability and advanced content knowledge prior to instruction. They were able to eliminate between 40%-50% of curricula for these students across content areas. Pre and post student achievement was examined using the Iowa Test of Basic Skills, and out-of-grade-level (one grade higher) tests were used to guard against ceiling effects. The results indicated that the achievement test scores of the students whose curriculum was compacted did not differ significantly from students whose curriculum was not compacted. These findings from a national study minimize teachers' fears about declines in students' achievement test scores due to compacting.",625.0,Curriculum compacting and achievement test scores: What does the research say?,1998.0

"Models of underachievement among gifted preadolescents: The role of personal, family, and school factors   This study explored individual, family, and school-related factors contributing to underachievement among gifted preadolescents. We explored three simple models of factors contributing to underachievement as well as a complex model incorporating all three factors. The complex model provided the best fit for the data, yet each of the three simple models was significant, suggesting the importance of an ecological approach to problems of underachievement among gifted students. intervention approaches deriving from each model were discussed.",629.0,"Models of underachievement among gifted preadolescents: The role of personal, family, and school factors",1998.0
"Concepts of mental activities and verbs in children of high and average verbal intelligence   In order to understand the contribution of increased cognitive abilities to children's naive theories of mind, children of high and average verbal intelligence rated their understanding of the interrelationships between and among mental activities and verbs. In Study 1, participants rated the similarity of pairs of prototypical mental activity scenarios according to the way you use your mind in each one. The scenarios represented the categories of list memory, prospective memory, comprehension, selective attention, inference, planning, comparison, and recognition. In Study 2, participants cited the similarity of cognitive and affective verbs (e.g. decide, memorize, love, worry). Multidimensional scaling and clustering analyses indicated very similar organization and structure of concepts in children of high and average verbal intelligence in both studies. These results add to the growing body of literature suggesting that metacognitive development and its association with intelligence differ depending on the type of metacognition being examined (Alexander, Carr & Schwanenflugel, 1995).",630.0,Concepts of mental activities and verbs in children of high and average verbal intelligence,1998.0
"Birth-order effects in the academically talented   Birth-order position was studied among 828 academically talented students from a national sample collected by the Institute for the Academic Advancement of Youth of Johns Hopkins University. When compared to 1990 U.S. Census Bureau data, this sample was disproportionately composed of first-born students. However, much of this birth order effect can be explained by the covariate of family size, with small families overrepresented among the gifted. First-born students tended to get higher verbal scores on the secondary School Admissions Test while youngest-born tended to do better in math. Students were administered the Rotter Internal-External Locus of Control Scale, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, the Multidimensional perfectionism Scale, the Adjective Check List, the NEO Five Factor inventory, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, and the Brief Symptom Inventory. Except for a mild relationship between birth order and perfectionistic type, there was no relationship found between birth-order position and personality and adjustment. It is believed that often reported birth-order position effects are strongly related to the covariance of family size.",631.0,Birth-order effects in the academically talented,1998.0
"Gender differences in teacher and student perceptions of gifted students' ability and effort   This study investigated whether female gifted students viewed the quality and importance of their work, effort, and ability differently than male gifted students. The study also investigated whether teachers perceived male and female students differently with respect to these areas in mathematics, language arts, social studies, and science. The sample included 5,385 fourth through eighth grade students who were identified as gifted and talented by their teachers. Teachers consistently rated females higher than males on effort and the quality of their work. Teachers rated males and females similarly on all abilities except language arts in which they rated females higher. Female students rated their language arts ability higher than males while the males rated their mathematics, science, and social studies abilities higher. The correlation between ratings of students' ability and quality of work and ratings of students' effort and quality or work were significantly different for students and teachers.",632.0,Gender differences in teacher and student perceptions of gifted students' ability and effort,1998.0
"Products of mind: Exploring student preferences for product development using my way ... an expression style instrument   In this article, students' preferences for creating potential products are explored through the use of an expression style inventory. A total of 3,532 students from 45 school districts in 24 states completed surveys designed to assess their interest in creating a variety of products. Factor analytic procedures yielded 11 factors with alpha reliabilities ranging from 72 to 95. The analysis allowed examination of the content and construct validity for the instrument. The article concludes with practical classroom applications for the expression style inventory in talent development programs such as those based on the Schoolwide enrichment Model (Renzulli & Reis, 1985).",633.0,Products of mind: Exploring student preferences for product development using my way ... an expression style instrument,1998.0
