"A GENERAL-THEORY FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF CREATIVE PRODUCTIVITY THROUGH THE PURSUIT OF IDEAL ACTS OF LEARNING   This article presents a general theory for developing creative productivity in young learners by examining the interactions between and among the learner, the curriculum, and the teacher. Further interactions within the learner dimension of the theory are examined by analyzing the relationships between and among learners' abilities, interests, and learning styles. Teacher interactions are examined by analyzing teachers' knowledge of the discipline that they are teaching, instructional techniques, and the teachers' ''romance'' with the discipline. The curriculum is examined by analyzing the structure of disciplines, the content and methodology of disciplines, and the discipline's appeal to the imagination of students. Also proposed is a three-dimensional research paradigm for examining creative productivity: (a) the types of creativity we are attempting to develop, (b) the domains in which creative pursuits are carried out, and (c) the contextual variables that influence the creative process.",819.0,A GENERAL-THEORY FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF CREATIVE PRODUCTIVITY THROUGH THE PURSUIT OF IDEAL ACTS OF LEARNING,1992.0
"CONTRIBUTIONS OF GIFTED EDUCATION TO GENERAL-EDUCATION IN A TIME OF CHANGE   Educators in the field of gifted education should be involved in the educational dialogue known as the School Reform Movement both because of the need of gifted learners for positive changes in education and because of the potential of the field to contribute to improved education for a wide range of students. Gifted youngsters, like others, suffer from inadequately trained teachers, test-driven instruction, low-level texts, and curricula which engage neither thought nor interest. They are further at risk in settings which mandate student homogeneity and in which teachers are prone to ''teach to the middle.'' Further, the field of gifted education, by virtue of its principles and practices, has the opportunity to provide educational leadership in expanding views of intelligence, attention to underserved populations, a broadened view of democracy in education, differentiation and individualization of instruction and varied instructional models and strategies.",820.0,CONTRIBUTIONS OF GIFTED EDUCATION TO GENERAL-EDUCATION IN A TIME OF CHANGE,1992.0
"EFFECTS OF THE FUTURE PROBLEM-SOLVING PROGRAM ON CHILDREN CONCERNS ABOUT THE FUTURE   The first purpose of this study was to determine whether gifted students participating in the Future Problem Solving Program would feel that they had more control over their futures than either other gifted or average-ability students. The second purpose was to determine whether participants' concerns about the future would differ from those of nonparticipants. The final purpose was to determine the most frequently mentioned concerns about the future of these groups of children. Subjects were from a medium-sized city in the Southwest and were fourth, fifth, and sixth graders. Results showed significant differences in students' perceptions of their control over the future and their concerns about the future. There were also differences among their most frequently mentioned concerns. Students in the Future Problem Solving Program were interested in more global issues than nonparticipants and were more positive about their control over the future.",821.0,EFFECTS OF THE FUTURE PROBLEM-SOLVING PROGRAM ON CHILDREN CONCERNS ABOUT THE FUTURE,1992.0
"THE EFFECTS OF PROBLEM-BASED LEARNING ON PROBLEM-SOLVING   Problem-based instruction is designed to provide students with a guided experience in solving an ill-structured problem. All learning in problem-based instruction stems from students' initial questions about a problem situation. Currently used in medical school programs, problem-based curriculum has not been tested at the high school level. Science, Society and the Future (SSF) is an experimental problem-based course for gifted high school students. In the interdisciplinary course, students examine the meaning and impact of current science issues (the effect of electromagnetic fields on childhood leukemia, the health care system). In this study, SSF students and a group of comparison students were tested to determine changes in their spontaneous use of problem-solving steps as they consider an ill-structured problem. Results show some significant changes for the SSF group not observed in the comparison group.",822.0,THE EFFECTS OF PROBLEM-BASED LEARNING ON PROBLEM-SOLVING,1992.0
"A DEVELOPMENTAL INVESTIGATION OF THE LIVES OF GIFTED WOMEN   Little research exists on intellectually gifted women in relation to their educational, personal, and career choices. This study explores the internal and external factors affecting educational and occupational choices made by gifted women at various times in their lives. A questionnaire was administered to a sample of intellectually gifted women representing the decades of the 1910s through the 1980s who attended a highly selective school for gifted females. Differences in personality and attitude factors were found across decades of graduation and between homemakers and career-oriented intellectually gifted women.",823.0,A DEVELOPMENTAL INVESTIGATION OF THE LIVES OF GIFTED WOMEN,1992.0
"A LONGITUDINAL EXAMINATION OF LIFE CHOICES OF GIFTED AND TALENTED YOUNG-WOMEN   The present study examines the reported achievements of 126 gifted and talented young women approximately 14 years after being identified by Project CHOICE staff. The examination is undertaken from an ipsative as well as a nomothetic perspective. The results indicate that (a) the educational and career attainment of these young women compare quite favorably both with other cohorts of gifted women and with criteria reflecting social expectation: (b) personal and relational accomplishments are identified almost as frequently as educational and career accomplishments as being their ''greatest achievements''; and (c) a substantial number of these young women at age 29 have yet to achieve the educational, career, and lifestyle aspirations they identified in adolescence. Implications for counseling gifted young women are discussed.",824.0,A LONGITUDINAL EXAMINATION OF LIFE CHOICES OF GIFTED AND TALENTED YOUNG-WOMEN,1992.0
"GIFTED PROGRAMS - GENDER DIFFERENCES IN REFERRAL AND ENROLLMENT   The purpose of this study was to examine girls' and boys' referral to and enrollment in gifted programs. Data on overall enrollment, referral, and referral outcome were obtained by gender and grade from five school boards offering gifted programs. A greater number of boys than girls were enrolled in gifted programs. When the referral process for the most recent year was examined, however, no gender differences were observed in referral or in decision to enroll. The variability in the results observed underlines the importance of longitudinal data in delineating more fully the occurrence and pattern of gender differences in referral to and enrollment in gifted programs.",825.0,GIFTED PROGRAMS - GENDER DIFFERENCES IN REFERRAL AND ENROLLMENT,1992.0

"CATCHING THE DREAM FOR GIFTED-CHILDREN OF COLOR   Gifted children of color are too frequently underrepresented among those labeled America's best and brightest, A Better Chance, Inc., a national academic talent search agency, has found more than 8,000 minority children and provided them with access to an excellent college preparatory education. Detecting, estimating, and evaluating intelligence is still typically based on test data and IQ scores. ABC has learned to use additional yardsticks: a strong sense of self, an independent mind, a questioning attitude, a willingness to take risks and to persevere. If educators are sincerely interested in identifying gifted children from all parts of American society, multiple assessment procedures, including objective and subjective data from a variety of sources, must be used. Within every classroom in this country, including those enrolling minorities and the disadvantaged, the proportion of gifted students is the same as that found in the nation's most affluent communities. It is our challenge as educators to find these gifted children. And we must find them quickly, before inertia and indifference immobilize their minds.",830.0,CATCHING THE DREAM FOR GIFTED-CHILDREN OF COLOR,1992.0
"THE IDENTIFICATION OF GIFTEDNESS - A COMPARISON OF WHITE, HISPANIC AND BLACK-FAMILIES   A survey was sent to White, Hispanic and Black parents of children in the gifted and talented program of a large urban school district. The results indicated that there were few differences among the three parent groups in either the characteristics that had indicated to them that their child might be gifted, or in the attributes which they believed were current descriptors of their gifted child. Large group differences were present, however, between the White sample and the two minority group samples in the percentage of families who requested an evaluation their child for possible placement in the gifted and talented program. Fewer of the minority parents such a request. This factor could contribute to the underrepresentation of minority students in gifted programs.",831.0,"THE IDENTIFICATION OF GIFTEDNESS - A COMPARISON OF WHITE, HISPANIC AND BLACK-FAMILIES",1992.0
"ACADEMIC UNDERACHIEVEMENT AMONG THE GIFTED - STUDENTS PERCEPTIONS OF FACTORS THAT REVERSE THE PATTERN   Underachievement among the gifted has been a focus of research for over 35 years. With few exceptions, studies of interventions for gifted underachievers have demonstrated only limited success. This study investigated factors which had influenced the reversal of the underachievement pattern in 10 gifted students, ages 14 to 20, who moved from chronic underachievement to academic success. Results indicated six factors were influential in reversing poor school performance. There was evidence that some gifted underachievers may respond well to interventions incorporating educational modifications which focus on individual strengths and interests.",832.0,ACADEMIC UNDERACHIEVEMENT AMONG THE GIFTED - STUDENTS PERCEPTIONS OF FACTORS THAT REVERSE THE PATTERN,1992.0
"FAST-PACED HIGH-SCHOOL SCIENCE FOR THE ACADEMICALLY TALENTED - A 6-YEAR PERSPECTIVE   This is a 6-year study of academically talented students, 12 to 16 years old, who completed a 1-year course in high school biology, chemistry, or physics in 3 weeks at a residential summer program. Students demonstrated subject mastery by taking College Entrance Examination Board (CEEB) science achievement tests. Their mean scores were higher than those of high school juniors and seniors. Also examined were the relationships between students' achievement in science and mathematical and verbal aptitude test scores, or age. Mathematical ability seemed to be a better predictor of science than verbal ability. Except for biology, there was no significant relationship between achievement and age. Follow-up studies of achievement indicated that students accelerated in science performed well in science courses at their regular schools. The study suggests that academically talented students could begin high school sciences earlier than is currently allowed in most American schools.",833.0,FAST-PACED HIGH-SCHOOL SCIENCE FOR THE ACADEMICALLY TALENTED - A 6-YEAR PERSPECTIVE,1992.0
"THE USE OF THE SECONDARY-SCHOOL ADMISSION TEST (SSAT) TO IDENTIFY ACADEMICALLY TALENTED ELEMENTARY-SCHOOL STUDENTS   Based on the results of two pilot testing projects, the Secondary School Admission Test appears to be an acceptable instrument for identifying academically talented students of elementary school age. In trials consistent with the Talent Search Identification Model developed at The Johns Hopkins University, an above-level form of the SSAT was administered to two samples of fifth and sixth graders. Mean scores for eighth- and ninth-grade normative samples are recommended as cutoffs for identifying highly able fifth- and sixth-grade students who could benefit from academically challenging programming.",834.0,THE USE OF THE SECONDARY-SCHOOL ADMISSION TEST (SSAT) TO IDENTIFY ACADEMICALLY TALENTED ELEMENTARY-SCHOOL STUDENTS,1992.0
"IN WHAT WAYS MIGHT STATEWIDE ADVOCATES FOR GIFTED AND TALENTED EDUCATION COORDINATE AND FOCUS THEIR EFFORTS   When advocates for gifted and talented education in the state of Utah found that their overall efforts seemed diffused and uncoordinated, they used creative problem-solving processes to address their common concerns. The result was the ratification of a concise, mutually acceptable mission and goals statement that was designed to give direction to statewide efforts on behalf of gifted and talented children for years to come. The document provides focus and direction by defining common goals and recognizing ownership of the logical tasks belonging to each advocacy group. Flexibility for future growth and development in the field of education of the gifted is a salient feature of the goals described. The impact of the document was felt immediately in improved services for children, better inservice training for educators, and more focused policy at the state level.",835.0,IN WHAT WAYS MIGHT STATEWIDE ADVOCATES FOR GIFTED AND TALENTED EDUCATION COORDINATE AND FOCUS THEIR EFFORTS,1992.0

"GROUPING GIFTED STUDENTS - ISSUES AND CONCERNS   Gifted and talented students need instruction at a level and pace as well as conceptual complexity commensurate with their advanced levels of ability and achievement. Grouping heterogeneously and providing cooperative learning in heterogeneous groups leads to lowered achievement and motivation as well as poorer attitudes toward school. Academic achievement of American youth is lower than the achievement of youth in many Asian and European countries. If we wish to sustain or increase the academic achievement of American youth they should be grouped for instruction according to ability and achievement levels, but grouping practices should be flexible, and rigid tracking should be avoided.",837.0,GROUPING GIFTED STUDENTS - ISSUES AND CONCERNS,1992.0

The author focuses on the fundamental importance of these two provisions for the gifted, examines them in the current context of school reform, and recommends a set of decision-making guidelines for practitioners to adopt for each issue. Acceleration guidelines include an emphasis on progressive development of learning based on mastery in content areas, flexibility in entrance and exit requirements for courses, and opportunities for telescoping and grade skipping. Grouping guidelines stress flexibility, opportunities for various forms of grouping, and independent learning options.",838.0,EDUCATIONAL DECISION-MAKING ON ACCELERATION AND GROUPING,1992.0
"META-ANALYTIC FINDINGS ON GROUPING PROGRAMS   Meta-analytic reviews have focused on five distinct instructional programs that separate students by ability: multilevel classes, cross-grade programs, within-class grouping, enriched classes for the gifted and talented, and accelerated classes. The reviews show that effects are a function of program type. Multilevel classes, which entail only minor adjustment of course content for ability groups, usually have little or no effect on student achievement. Programs that entail more substantial adjustment of curriculum to ability, such as cross-grade and within-class programs, produce clear positive effects. Programs of enrichment and acceleration, which usually involve the greatest amount of curricular adjustment, have the largest effects on student learning. These results do not support recent claims that no one benefits from grouping or that students in the lower groups are harmed academically and emotionally by grouping.",839.0,META-ANALYTIC FINDINGS ON GROUPING PROGRAMS,1992.0
"MATHEMATICS ACCELERATION OF HIGHLY TALENTED STUDENTS - AN EVALUATION   The purpose of this study was to investigate the precollege mathematics preparation of students with high mathematical aptitude, most of whom were highly accelerated in mathematics. The nature and extent of mathematics coursework and math-related activities and measures of student achievement during the secondary school years were examined. Students evaluated their precollege mathematics preparation in terms of course availability and difficulty, school cooperation, and overall satisfaction. The typical student took calculus in Grade 9, followed by advanced mathematics coursework studied at a local college or magnet high school. Some students experienced difficulty in locating an appropriately challenging and cohesive course of study after first year calculus while still in high school. Despite students' radical acceleration, achievement in calculus and postcalculus coursework was high. Out-of-school math-related activities were prevalent. Gender differences were found in the degree of acceleration and choice of college major. Recommendations for a suitable precollege math program for this population are offered.",840.0,MATHEMATICS ACCELERATION OF HIGHLY TALENTED STUDENTS - AN EVALUATION,1992.0
"THE IMPACT OF EARLY ENTRANCE TO COLLEGE ON SELF-ESTEEM - A PRELIMINARY-STUDY   In a study investigating the effects of an early entrance to college program on self-esteem, students in the Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science (TAMS) completed the Adult Form of the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory (SEI) the week they began and again after one semester of participation in the program, a time period when the greatest changes in self-esteem would be anticipated. Overall differences between TAMS pretests and posttests were nonsignificant or negligible, indicating that the students' self-esteem did not change in a meaningful way during their first semester in the program. A number of items on the SEI showed significant changes, all in a negative direction. On the pretest, TAMS students did not differ significantly from subjects in SEI normative groups on any items. On the posttest, however, there were some differences in a negative direction. Observed changes in self-esteem may be attributed to the adjustment that all college freshmen experience when they leave home for the first time, as well as to changes in social comparisons.",841.0,THE IMPACT OF EARLY ENTRANCE TO COLLEGE ON SELF-ESTEEM - A PRELIMINARY-STUDY,1992.0
"THE USE OF RADICAL ACCELERATION IN CASES OF EXTREME INTELLECTUAL PRECOCITY   This paper reviews the school histories of five extremely gifted children, of IQ 160 - 200, who have been radically accelerated. Prior to their acceleration, the children were retained in the regular classroom in a lockstep curriculum based on their chronological age and grade placement. They suffered severe intellectual frustration, boredom, lack of motivation, and social rejection by age-peers. and displayed significantly lowered levels of social self-esteem. A combination of grade-skipping and radical subject matter acceleration has given the children access to curricula commensurate with their academic achievement levels and the intellectual and social companionship of children who share their abilities and interests. The young accelerands are more stimulated intellectually, enjoy closer and more productive social relationships, and display healthier levels of social self-esteem than do equally gifted children who have been retained with age-peers of average ability.",842.0,THE USE OF RADICAL ACCELERATION IN CASES OF EXTREME INTELLECTUAL PRECOCITY,1992.0
"THE USE OF SUBJECT AND GRADE SKIPPING FOR THE PREVENTION AND REVERSAL OF UNDERACHIEVEMENT   Acceleration, including early entrance to kindergarten, grade skipping, and subject skipping, has been used as a strategy to prevent and reverse underachievement in a selected group of gifted students. Fourteen sets of parents and 11 students were interviewed to determine their perceptions of the effectiveness of the acceleration strategy. All the parents and all the students indicated they would make the same decision again. Only two of the school administrators and six of the receiving teachers were initially positive about the skipping, but most of them changed their positions with the child's success, at least in regard to the specific accelerated child. There appeared to be a period (between one quarter and a semester) during which teachers expressed concern over the students' adjustment, but students did not perceive themselves as having adjustment difficulties.",843.0,THE USE OF SUBJECT AND GRADE SKIPPING FOR THE PREVENTION AND REVERSAL OF UNDERACHIEVEMENT,1992.0

The levels and types of programming offered to gifted students in rural and urban school districts were compared in this study. Rural and urban districts were also compared on their uses of ability grouping in regular education programs and academic acceleration. The results of the study revealed that rural school districts are less apt to use ability grouping or academic acceleration to provide a developed range of options for gifted and talented students. Sporadic extra-curricular activities tend to play more important roles in rural programs.

A Lesson Plan Evaluation Form (LPEF) was developed to provide systematic quantitative data about classroom functioning that are usually obtained only through attitudinal surveys. One hundred thirty-seven plans from 15 teachers were analyzed. The lesson plan analysis yielded useful information about program functioning in a cost-effective manner.

This study provides data on the relationship between specific items perceived by parents to be indicators of giftedness in their young children and the children's actual measured ability level. Parental beliefs were found to be associated with actual IQ status. In particular, parents' beliefs about memory, creativity-imagination, and abstract thinking abilities were associated with higher IQ, and knowledge of body parts with lower IQ. These data suggest that (a) parents have specific and differentiated beliefs concerning the constituents of giftedness in their young children, (b) parents exhibit a fairly high degree of accuracy in their judgements of their children's ability level, and (c) parental beliefs differ as a function of the actual ability level of their children.",854.0,PARENTAL BELIEFS ABOUT GIFTEDNESS IN YOUNG-CHILDREN AND THEIR RELATION TO ACTUAL ABILITY LEVEL,1992.0
"DO TEACHERS REACT TO MULTIPLE INTELLIGENCES - EFFECTS OF TEACHERS STEREOTYPES ON JUDGMENTS AND EXPECTANCIES FOR STUDENTS WITH DIVERSE PATTERNS OF GIFTEDNESS TALENT   This research examined how teachers' judgments, expectancies, and decisions were influenced by hypothetical students' patterns of giftedness and demographic characteristics. The study involved 158 prospective and experienced teachers who responded to six 1-page scenarios of students with varying backgrounds (gender, race, and socioeconomic status) and ability patterns (analytic, verbal, social, creative arts, motor, and control). Responses to each student included 25 trait ratings, judgments of appropriate programming and resources, and predictions of adult success. The findings indicate differential predictions of success, recommendations for programming and resources, and trait ratings for those with different patterns of giftedness and talent. For several trait ratings, teachers' reactions to ability patterns appeared to be magnified when the pattern was inconsistent with gender, race, or social class stereotypes. Overall, the findings of this study suggest that teachers may be sensitive to multiple intelligences (Gardner, 1983) if they are exposed to a sufficient range of information about individual students.",855.0,DO TEACHERS REACT TO MULTIPLE INTELLIGENCES - EFFECTS OF TEACHERS STEREOTYPES ON JUDGMENTS AND EXPECTANCIES FOR STUDENTS WITH DIVERSE PATTERNS OF GIFTEDNESS TALENT,1992.0
"GIFTED STUDENTS CONCEPTIONS OF ACADEMIC FUN - AN EXAMINATION OF A CRITICAL CONSTRUCT FOR GIFTED EDUCATION   Academic fun is hypothesized to consist largely of the degree of success an individual anticipates from an activity. In this context, fun relates to the levels of arousal and control perceived to be afforded by the task. Gifted elementary and middle school students' conceptions of academic fun were examined using repertory grid techniques (e.g., Kelly, 1955). Results indicate that students' conceptions of fun are highly similar across age and gender. However, differences in ratings of academic situations suggest that gifted boys view technology and computer activities as more fun than girls do. In addition, confirming many suspicions, age trends revealed that mathematics decreases in perceived fun as children progress through school.",856.0,GIFTED STUDENTS CONCEPTIONS OF ACADEMIC FUN - AN EXAMINATION OF A CRITICAL CONSTRUCT FOR GIFTED EDUCATION,1992.0
