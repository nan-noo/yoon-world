"Inequities of Enrollment in Gifted Education: A Statewide Application of the 20% Equity Allowance Formula gifted education; multicultural; equity; identification; Bayesian Underrepresentation in gifted education for ethnically diverse student groups has been widely recognized. Two recent federal district court decisions defined the lower limits of equitable participation using the 20% equity allowance formula proposed by Donna Ford. The purpose of this article was to evaluate the application of the 20% rule to identify the prevalence of inequity and associated variables in Texas gifted education programs. Using data from the Office of Civil Rights and Texas Education Agency, the authors applied the 20% rule to demographics of K-12 gifted education programs in Texas to identify inequity and used Bayesian regression with district characteristics to investigate contributing factors of inequity. Only 282 of 994 (28.4%) districts met equity standards for Hispanic students. Second, Bayesian regressions with district-level characteristics of students, teachers, and expenditures were used to identify factors associated with inequitable enrollment of Hispanic students. Overall, the model accounted for 12.9% variance (R-2 = 0.129, 95% highest density interval [0.095, 0.170]), with increasing variance explained by district subsets (i.e., city, suburb, town, rural). Furthermore, the results of the regression models revealed the percentage of Hispanic and White teachers were inversely associated with inequity across all district subsets. It is postulated that the mechanism of inequity is in the teacher referral process, frequently used as a determinant of gifted education enrollment. The authors suggest means of addressing this reality.",27.0,Inequities of Enrollment in Gifted Education: A Statewide Application of the 20% Equity Allowance Formula,2019.0
"The Effects of Academic Giftedness and Gender on Developmental Trajectories of Hopelessness Among Students Living in Economically Disadvantaged Neighborhoods gender; giftedness; hopelessness; poverty; growth curve modeling; longitudinal Although there is much research on adolescent poverty, research related to youth living in communities characterized by extreme poverty who are also identified as academically gifted is lacking. This study explores the development of hopelessness in these youths, compared with peers not identified as gifted, using data from the Mobile Youth and Poverty Study. Specifically, trajectories of hopelessness as a function of gifted status and gender are explored. Results indicate that boys experience greater feelings of hopelessness than girls, regardless of their gifted status, and students identified as gifted have lower levels of hopelessness than their peers not identified as gifted. These latter differences are particularly pronounced during early adolescence (age 10 years) but decline over time and largely disappear by later adolescence (age 18 years). Results suggest that boys may be particularly vulnerable to declining effects of gifted classification as a protector against hopelessness across age and that disadvantaged students who are identified as gifted may benefit from gifted programs that continue at an intense level through their high school years.",28.0,The Effects of Academic Giftedness and Gender on Developmental Trajectories of Hopelessness Among Students Living in Economically Disadvantaged Neighborhoods,2019.0
"Machine Learning in Gifted Education: A Demonstration Using Neural Networks gifted education; supervised learning; neural networks Machine learning algorithms are used in language processing, automated driving, and for prediction. Though the theory of machine learning has existed since the 1950s, it was not until the advent of advanced computing that their potential has begun to be realized. Gifted education is a field where machine learning has yet to be utilized, even though one of the underlying problems of gifted education is classification, which is an area where learning algorithms have become exceptionally accurate. We provide a brief overview of machine learning with a focus on neural networks and supervised learning, followed by a demonstration using simulated data and neural networks for classification issues with a practical explanation of the mechanics of the neural network and associated R code. Implications for gifted education are then discussed. Finally, the limitations of supervised learning are discussed.

"Who Gets Served in Gifted Education? Demographic Representation and a Call for Action equity; underrepresentation; assessment; gifted The disproportional representation of students from various demographic subgroups within identified gifted and talented populations has long frustrated policy makers, education advocates, researchers practitioners within the field, and those concerned with societal inequality in general. Despite the prevalence of articles in the media reporting on disproportional representation, little research has been conducted to track whether (a) the representation of these student subgroups, particularly students with limited English proficiency or students with disabilities, has changed over time or (b) states with and without policies differ in proportional representation of students identified with gifts and talents. For example, increasingly, gifted education advocates have pushed for mandates that all students be screened for gifted program eligibility as a way to combat disproportionality, despite little evidence that such methods influence proportionality. Therefore, this study sought to understand whether and how state and national gifted program demographics have changed over time and how proportionality is correlated with state mandates for gifted education identification or services.

"What Boosts Talent Development? Examining Predictors of Academic Growth in Secondary School Among Academically Advanced Youth Across 21 Years academically gifted; academic talent We examined 482,418 students who took the ACT in the seventh grade and again in high school, taking an exploratory analytic approach to examine academic growth trends from 1996 to 2017. Predictors included sociodemographics, interests, high school (HS) characteristics, HS coursework and GPA, and extracurriculars, which explained 25% of the variance in academic growth. Overall, growth improved from 2005 to 2017, but growth for low-income and Hispanic students was stagnant. Catholic and private school students had the highest growth; homeschooled and high-poverty public school students had the lowest. High growth was associated with STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) elective HS courses and advanced AP, accelerated, and honors courses. Students with investigative and conventional interests had higher growth. Some extracurriculars had significant relationships with academic growth, though the effects were small.",31.0,What Boosts Talent Development?

"Presenting a Qualitative Study: A Reviewer's Perspective qualitative research; new researchers; researcher bias; approaches; trustworthiness Intended to guide scholars who are new to qualitative research, this methods brief focuses mostly on what reviewers look for in manuscripts submitted for publication. The author acknowledges that reviewers' preferences likely reflect their theoretical perspectives, research-oriented coursework, mentors, and research and writing experiences. The emphasis, therefore, is on terminology and basic elements that apply across a broad range of qualitative approaches. Discussion also addresses researcher inclinations toward qualitative inquiry; the importance of fit among approach, purpose, and research questions; the need for manuscript authors to identify potential researcher bias and explain how it was monitored; and the necessity of including and describing other elements that contribute to trustworthiness. Examples from journals in the field represent a wide range of research types, foci, and data sources.",32.0,Presenting a Qualitative Study: A Reviewer's Perspective,2019.0
"On Deciding to Accelerate: High-Ability Students Identify Key Considerations acceleration; group concept mapping; gifted; student beliefs; high-ability students; student voice Acceleration is a well-researched educational intervention supporting positive outcomes for high-ability students. However, access to acceleration may be restricted due to educators' misapprehensions about this practice. To better understand whether students share educators' concerns, our study explored 26 high-ability students' beliefs about important considerations in grade-based acceleration. Seventeen high-ability students who had accelerated (age 9-14 years) participated in group concept mapping activities, which involved sorting and rating a list of student-generated considerations. We applied multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis to the sorted data to create a structured conceptualization of students' advice on deciding to accelerate. Our analyses revealed the following six key concepts, from most to least important: (a) Best Learning Environment, (b) Child's Preferences, (c) Abilities Across Different Subjects, (d) Peer Group, (e) Context and School Support, and (f) Social Considerations. Our interpretations include comparison of high-ability students' advice to existing acceleration guidelines. Practical implications are discussed.",33.0,On Deciding to Accelerate: High-Ability Students Identify Key Considerations,2019.0
"Giftedness in the Making: A Transactional Perspective definition and; or conception of giftedness; talent; philosophical; theoretical; history; inclusion; egalitarianism; symbolic interactionism; social construct; affordance; self-knowledge; ecological psychology Over the past century, strong applications of psychometrics have resulted in an ideology and practices of identification in the field of gifted education. In recent years, an alternative ideology that construes giftedness in an inclusive light and promotes democratic practices has emerged. This ideology posits a new meaning-making system of giftedness that is process-based rather than person-based. In this article, we elaborate some conceptual principles of this emerging ideology. First, we reflect on the nature of giftedness as a social construct using a symbolic interactionist perspective and articulate the dialectical evolution of collective meanings of giftedness. Second, we address the interdependency between an individual and a context when it comes to helping students realize their giftedness. Third, we accentuate a growth orientation and outline the importance of considering giftedness as a process-based entity. Furthermore, we provide a T:CAD conception of giftedness along with ideas for transaction-focused practices that aim to encourage the rendering of this emerging ideology in practice.",34.0,Giftedness in the Making: A Transactional Perspective,2019.0
"From A (Aggression) to V (Victimization): Peer Status and Adjustment Among Academically Gifted Students in Early Adolescence peers; social; emotional; adolescents; academically gifted; path analysis Peer status is an important indicator and predictor of adjustment. While gifted children tend to enjoy favorable peer status, their social functioning during adolescence is less clear. The current study seeks to enhance this understanding by examining both preference- and reputation-based peer status of gifted adolescents. Peer nominations were used to assess the peer status, aggression, victimization, and prosocial leadership of 327 public school seventh graders (44% male; 42% White). School records provided giftedness information, course grade, and standardized test scores, and substance use was self-reported. Gifted students were viewed as less aggressive and more prosocial and had higher academic achievement than nonidentified students. Giftedness moderated the peer status-adjustment relationship. Rejection related to higher victimization and test scores, but these associations were most exaggerated for gifted students. Popularity positively related to aggression and substance use; however, the associations were greatly attenuated for gifted students. Findings underscore the heterogeneity of gifted adolescents' social experiences.",35.0,From A (Aggression) to V (Victimization): Peer Status and Adjustment Among Academically Gifted Students in Early Adolescence,2019.0

"Coaching Parents to Use Higher Level Questioning With Their Twice-Exceptional Children twice exceptional; higher level questioning; shared reading; single-case design; parents This study investigated the impact of training and coaching parents to use a higher level questioning strategy during shared reading time at home on the expressive language complexity of their young twice-exceptional children. Four parents were trained and coached to use higher level questions, based on the revised Bloom's taxonomy, with their children in home settings during a shared reading routine. A single-case, multiple-probe design across participants was used to examine the parents' ability to learn and implement the higher level questioning strategy during shared reading with their children and the impact this had on the complexity of their children's expressive language. Results indicated that all parents were able to learn and implement the strategy, and the complexity of each child's responses increased. Additionally, these findings were maintained over time and demonstrated that single-case research can be used with gifted student populations to establish causal relationships between interventions and meaningful outcomes.",37.0,Coaching Parents to Use Higher Level Questioning With Their Twice-Exceptional Children,2019.0
"Clarifying the Connections Among Giftedness, Metacognition, Self-Regulation, and Self-Regulated Learning: Implications for Theory and Practice definition or conception of giftednes; talent; metacognition; self-regulation; self-regulated learning The concept of giftedness has historically been shaped by theories of IQ, creativity, and expertise (including early conceptions of metacognition). These theories focus within the mind of the individual learner. Social, emotional, and motivational qualities of giftedness were treated as add-ons, not part of the core construct. This created misalignment with the social construction of knowledge-a position widely supported in gifted education practice. Newer, broader conceptions of metacognitive, self-regulated, and self-regulated learning processes have garnered interest. However, because these theories borrowed language from each other and earlier theories, assigning new meanings to old constructs, confusion arose about how to distinguish each of these three theories from each other or apply them to instruction. This article distinguishes among metacognition, self-regulation, and self-regulated learning, relating each to notions of giftedness, highlighting implications for practice, and especially highlighting self-regulated learning as a valuable contributor to understanding giftedness and designing instruction in gifted education.",38.0,"Clarifying the Connections Among Giftedness, Metacognition, Self-Regulation, and Self-Regulated Learning: Implications for Theory and Practice",2019.0
"The Influence of Parental and Self-Expectations on Asian American Women Who Entered College Early college or adult; special population; underserved gifted; qualitative methodologies; social an; or emotional development and adjustment; gifted females Asian immigrant parents may hold high expectations for their children to excel academically and professionally. Filial piety and the desire to make their parent(s) proud can motivate these children to achieve but can also place undue pressure on them. In this qualitative study, researchers explored how seven Asian American women who entered college 2 to 4 years earlier than same-aged peers perceived their parents' expectations and the influence of these expectations on their academic and career decision making. In-depth interviews revealed that the majority of women experienced high expectations from their parents for academics and careers. Several also reported experiencing parental pressures, social isolation, eating disorders, and depression during their college years. Implications for well-being are discussed.",39.0,The Influence of Parental and Self-Expectations on Asian American Women Who Entered College Early,2019.0

"An Evaluation (and Vindication?) of Lewis Terman: What the Father of Gifted Education Can Teach the 21st Century philosophical/theoretical; history of gifted education; Lewis Terman Lewis Terman is widely seen as the father of gifted education, yet his work is controversial. Terman's mixed legacy includes the pioneering work in the creation of intelligence tests, the first large-scale longitudinal study, and the earliest discussions of gifted identification, curriculum, ability grouping, acceleration, and more. However, since the 1950s, Terman has been viewed as a sloppy thinker at best and a racist, sexist, and/or classist at worst. This article explores the most common criticisms of Terman's legacy: an overemphasis on IQ, support for the meritocracy, and emphasizing genetic explanations for the origin of intelligence differences over environmental ones. Each of these criticisms is justified to some extent by the historical record, and each is relevant today. Frequently overlooked, however, is Terman's willingness to form a strong opinion based on weak data. The article concludes with a discussion of the important lessons that Terman's work has for modern educators and psychologists, including his contributions to psychometrics and gifted education, his willingness to modify his opinions in the face of new evidence, and his inventiveness and inclination to experiment. Terman's legacy is complex, but one that provides insights that can enrich modern researchers and practitioners in these areas.",41.0,An Evaluation (and Vindication?) of Lewis Terman: What the Father of Gifted Education Can Teach the 21st Century,2019.0
"A Longitudinal Case Study of Exceptional Leadership Talent longitudinal research; qualitative methodologies; leadership talent The development of leadership talent in a gifted individual was the focus of this 15-year longitudinal case study. Four major themes explained the development of his leadership talent. Crucial family factors and support served as a foundation for his psychosocial development and contributed significantly to his talents as a leader. Emotional intelligence evident in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood was an important asset as his leadership skills grew. In addition, strong practical intelligence applied to his everyday life enabled him to meet the goals and objectives he established for himself. Woven throughout his life story was evidence of a strong internal motivation that drove him personally and professionally. Implications of the findings are presented along with suggestions for designing effective leadership development experiences for talented students.",42.0,A Longitudinal Case Study of Exceptional Leadership Talent,2019.0

In the first phase, interview data from 26 Australian adolescents, who were simultaneously intellectually gifted and of low socioeconomic status background, were analyzed using grounded theory to develop four models of occupational/career decision-making processes. In the second phase, a model that incorporated all of the constructs and relationships identified in each of the four models developed in the first phase of the study was tested and refined using structural equation modeling procedures on survey data collected from 917 economically disadvantaged intellectually gifted Australian adolescents. The resulting qualitatively developed and quantitatively refined model allowed for a clearer and a more complete understanding of the occupational/career decision-making processes of intellectually gifted adolescents from economically disadvantaged backgrounds.",43.0,The Occupational/Career Decision-Making Processes of Intellectually Gifted Adolescents From Economically Disadvantaged Backgrounds: A Mixed Methods Perspective,2019.0
"Profoundly Gifted Students' Perceptions of Virtual Classrooms gifted education; profoundly gifted; online learning; virtual classrooms The intent of this case study is to understand profoundly gifted students' perceptions of virtual programs. The participants for this study were five profoundly gifted students who were enrolled in a fully virtual writing course hosted by a school that serves the profoundly gifted population. The researcher gathered data via asynchronous focus groups on an online discussion board, observations of synchronous sessions in their virtual classroom, and individual interviews with the participants. The participants reported a preference for frequent interactions with classmates and the instructor, but expressed concern about the lack of social opportunities. While technical difficulties did occur, these were mostly due to operator error or disuse of available tools. Finally, in terms of curriculum and pedagogy, the participants saw little difference between brick-and-mortar and virtual classrooms, suggesting that for profoundly gifted students, the quality of the content and instruction outweighs the realities of the learning environment. This information can be used either to improve online gifted education, or create new programs, thus diversifying opportunities.",44.0,Profoundly Gifted Students' Perceptions of Virtual Classrooms,2019.0
