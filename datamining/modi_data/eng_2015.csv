"Subjective Well-Being of Gifted American College Students: An Examination of Psychometric Properties of the PWI-A college or adult; social and; or emotional development and adjustment; programming; service delivery models; assessment This study examined the psychometric properties of the Personal Well-being Index for Adults (PWI-A), a measure of subjective well-being. The study used data from 533 high-ability American college students: honors students and participants in an early college entrance program. In earlier studies using the PWI-A, the instrument appeared to show differences in disaggregated aspects of well-being for these gifted college students. Unfortunately, the careful psychometric examination of the instrument done in this study showed that the PWI-A, as it currently is constituted, did not perform as hoped for assessing changes in the disaggregated aspects of well-being among groups of gifted college students. The single-factor structure of PWI-A showed support for convergent validity, but error correlations indicated lack of support for discriminant validity. The current analysis of the PWI-A scores showed good internal consistency, but the instrument lacked measurement invariance across honors and early entrance students. Four of the seven items exhibited differential item functioning across the two groups. The lack of full measurement invariance indicated room for refinement of the instrument as applied to measuring the well-being of high-ability college students. The results of the current study suggest that to measure accurately the disaggregated well-being of gifted and talented young people, a new, revised, or expanded instrument is necessary. More and diverse items per subscale in a new or revised instrument would allow a more accurate assessment of the specific aspects of the well-being of gifted and talented individuals.",119.0,Subjective Well-Being of Gifted American College Students: An Examination of Psychometric Properties of the PWI-A,2015.0
"Conceptualizing Concurrent Enrollment: Why High-Achieving Students Go For It concurrent enrollment; dual enrollment; Trochim's concept mapping; acceleration; self-determination theory Research shows that carefully planned acceleration offers academic benefits with little social or emotional risk to high-ability learners. However, acceleration is underutilized and little is known about students' motivations to accelerate. In this study, 21 high-ability high school students in Grades 11 and 12 took part in a structured conceptualization exercise that revealed why they chose to concurrently enroll in university courses. Participants brainstormed responses to a focus prompt, then structured the data by sorting and rating their responses. The structured data were analyzed using multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis to produce a cluster map of participants' motivations. In order of importance, key concepts included (a) university preparation, (b) demonstrating initiative, (c) getting ahead, (d) love of learning, (e) self-fulfillment, (f) seeking challenge, and (g) socializing. The key concepts were examined within a self-determination theory framework. Study findings provide a deeper understanding of high-achieving students' views on concurrent enrollment. Educational and research implications are discussed.",120.0,Conceptualizing Concurrent Enrollment: Why High-Achieving Students Go For It,2015.0
"Lived Experiences of Parents of Gifted Students With Autism Spectrum Disorder: The Struggle to Find Appropriate Educational Experiences autism spectrum disorder; giftedness; twice-exceptional; parents; education services The purpose of this phenomenological, qualitative study was to illuminate the lived, shared experiences of parents of gifted children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. Thirteen parents were interviewed and the interviews were transcribed and qualitatively analyzed. This article specifically examines the parents' experiences navigating the educational system for their children. All participants described the challenges associated with finding appropriate educational placements for their children due to the children's unique social and academic needs. Parents recognized the incompatibility between their child's characteristics and typical educational environments, and this incompatibility required parents to take an active role in designing and finding appropriate educational opportunities. These findings provide insight for school personnel and parents as they develop flexible services for twice-exceptional students.",121.0,Lived Experiences of Parents of Gifted Students With Autism Spectrum Disorder: The Struggle to Find Appropriate Educational Experiences,2015.0
"Retrospective Perceptions of Graduates of a Self-Contained Program in Taiwan for High School Students Talented in STEM male gifted students; self-contained gifted program; secondary education; STEM; science education; mathematics education This retrospective qualitative study was designed to investigate perceptions of the learning experiences of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics)-talented male students who were in a self-contained, single-gender, gifted program in a selective high school in Taiwan. Twenty-four graduates of the high school's gifted program completed a confidential survey and participated in one-on-one interviews. The participants identified the most valuable learning experience as the independent study course; they reported that the independent study course influenced their choice of college major and positively affected their studies in their senior year of college. Most participants valued their overall academic experience in the self-contained program, although a few reported that they were unable to learn so many science-related subjects simultaneously at such a fast pace, suggesting that this type of program needs to be differentiated. The social impacts of the program varied. Implications of the findings for educators as well as suggestions for future research are discussed.",122.0,Retrospective Perceptions of Graduates of a Self-Contained Program in Taiwan for High School Students Talented in STEM,2015.0
"Gifted Students' Implicit Beliefs About Intelligence and Giftedness giftedness; implicit beliefs; intelligence Growing attention is being paid to individuals' implicit beliefs about the nature of intelligence. However, implicit beliefs about giftedness are currently underexamined. In the current study, we examined academically gifted adolescents' implicit beliefs about both intelligence and giftedness. Overall, participants' implicit beliefs about giftedness and intelligence were significantly positively correlated while also having statistically significant mean differences, suggesting that they perceived the nature of the two constructs differently. Specifically, many students viewed intelligence as malleable (incremental view) and giftedness as fixed (entity view), whereas very few students viewed giftedness as malleable and intelligence as fixed; however, heterogeneity was observed. The beliefs identified in the current study provide important insight into the domain-specific nature of implicit beliefs of gifted students and suggest that caution be used against using terms like giftedness and intelligence interchangeably.",123.0,Gifted Students' Implicit Beliefs About Intelligence and Giftedness,2015.0
"Gifted Adults: A Systematic Review and Analysis of the Literature adults; giftedness; eminence; lifespan What happens when a gifted child grows up? Despite a slew of provocative book titles regarding gifted adults in the mainstream media, and the inclusion of the notion of giftedness among adults in the definition of giftedness proposed by Subotnik, Olszewski-Kubilius, and Worrell, there is a limited amount of research that has examined the gifted adult. In this systematic review of the literature, we categorized the available research literature into nine thematic areas: (a) whether or not gifted children become gifted adults; (b) family of origin; (c) effects of early educational experiences; (d) characteristics of gifted adults; (e) career; (f) family of procreation; (g) career and family interaction; (h) life goals, satisfaction, and well-being; and (i) counseling. Implications for gifted adults and the field of gifted education are discussed.",124.0,Gifted Adults: A Systematic Review and Analysis of the Literature,2015.0
"Gifted Students' Perceptions of an Accelerated Summer Program and Social Support social and; or emotional development and adjustment; multivariate analyses; secondary Using survey responses from students who participated in the summer programs at two university-based gifted education institutions, this study examined changes in gifted students' perceptions of their learning environments, accelerated summer programs and regular schools, and social support in lives after participation in the summer programs. Our sample of gifted students was generally favorable about their classroom experiences and interactions with their teachers both in the gifted programs and regular school classes. Some noticeable differences were greater acceptance and support for giftedness, a stronger connection to peers, and greater ease in peer relationships reported during the programs, and enhanced maturity and orientation toward future after the programs. While all students relied on family and peers as sources of social support before, during and after the summer programs, older students also endorsed being able to rely more on themselves. Perceptions of greater social support seemed to be related to more positive assessment of students' summer and school classes, although causality can go in either direction. Overall, this study suggests that gifted students' summer program experiences may be instrumental in receiving affirmation about their giftedness from peers, enhancing independence and maturity for academic life, and building stronger belief in themselves.",125.0,Gifted Students' Perceptions of an Accelerated Summer Program and Social Support,2015.0
"An Introduction to Replication Research in Gifted Education: Shiny and New Is Not the Same as Useful gifted education; replication; research methods This methodological brief introduces readers to replication methods and their uses. Broadly defined, replication is the duplication of previously conducted research to verify or expand the original findings. Replication is particularly useful in the gifted education context because so much education theory and research are based on general education students and environments; the extent to which this prior work extends to gifted education contexts needs to be evaluated. The rationale, definition, implementation methods, and current state of replication in the social sciences generally, as well as in giftedness and creativity research specifically, are reviewed. Finally, guidance for conducting replications is provided, including recommendations on selecting important topics, engaging original authors, ensuring sufficient power, using appropriate measures and analyses, framing the manuscript, and submission planning.",126.0,An Introduction to Replication Research in Gifted Education: Shiny and New Is Not the Same as Useful,2015.0
"Giftedness and Aesthetics: Perspectives of Expert Mathematicians and Mathematically Gifted Students expert mathematicians; mathematically gifted students; mathematics problem-solving; mathematical aesthetics; mathematical creativity Giftedness in mathematics has been characterized by exceptional attributes including strong mathematical memory, formalizing perception, generalization, curtailment, flexibility, and elegance. Focusing on the last attribute, this study examined the following: (a) the criteria which expert mathematicians and mathematically gifted students fleshed out to identify their own most preferred mathematics problem-solving approaches and (b) the extent to which students perceived expert mathematicians' preferences for one approach over the others as aesthetically pleasing. The findings suggested that: (a) unlike expert mathematicians who saw beauty in mathematics as an exhaustive consequence of simplicity and originality, mathematically gifted students found mathematical elegance only in approaches that were efficient in terms of time and number of steps to solve the problems and (b) although expert mathematicians considered mathematically gifted students' most preferred approaches to be the least beautiful, mathematically gifted students, showing no enthusiasm, considered expert mathematicians' most preferred approaches to be no more attractive than their own approaches.",127.0,Giftedness and Aesthetics: Perspectives of Expert Mathematicians and Mathematically Gifted Students,2015.0
"The Academic Gap: An International Comparison of the Time Allocation of Academically Talented Students academic talent; cross-cultural; gender differences; gifted; time allocation Despite growing concern about the need to develop talent across the globe, relatively little empirical research has examined how students develop their academic talents. Toward this end, the current study explored how academically talented students from the United States and India spend their time both in and out of school. Indian students reported spending roughly 11 more hours on academics than their U.S. peers during the weekend in both STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) and non-STEM topics. U.S. students reported spending about 5.4 more hours than their Indian peers on non-STEM academics during the week, leaving an approximately 7-hour-a-week academic gap between U.S. and Indian students. Additionally, U.S. students reported using electronics over 14 hours per week more than their Indian peers. Indian students also reported having control over a greater proportion of their time during the week than U.S. students did. Generally, there were far more cross-cultural differences than gender differences. These results inform discussions on how academically talented students develop within educational systems as well as what each culture supports in and out of school.",128.0,The Academic Gap: An International Comparison of the Time Allocation of Academically Talented Students,2015.0
"Using Design-Based Research in Gifted Education design-based research; process-oriented; context-sensitive Design-based research (DBR) is a new methodological framework that was developed in the context of the learning sciences; however, it has not been used very often in the field of gifted education. Compared with other methodologies, DBR is more process-oriented and context-sensitive. In this methodological brief, the authors introduce DBR and explain why it can be useful to researchers in the field of gifted education. The authors give an overview of the history and the key features of DBR, then discuss the challenges of using DBR. Based on both the literature and the authors' experiences using DBR as a framework in their own empirical studies, suggestions are provided to help gifted education researchers who would like to use DBR.",129.0,Using Design-Based Research in Gifted Education,2015.0
"The Reciprocal Effects Model Revisited: Extending Its Reach to Gifted Students Attending Academically Selective Schools reciprocal effects model; selective education; academic self-concept; academic achievement; gifted students The reciprocal effects model (REM) predicts a reciprocal relation between academic self-concept and academic achievement, whereby prior academic self-concept is associated with future gains in achievement, and prior achievement is related to subsequent academic self-concept. Although research in this area has been extensive, there has been a paucity of research specifically examining the REM from the standpoint of students who attend academically selective schools. The present research aimed to rectify this gap in the literature by testing the equivalence of the REM across a sample of high school students who attend both academically selective (n = 738) and mixed-ability comprehensive (n = 2,048) schools. Multigroup analyses revealed that the REM existed for both groups and that there were no differences between the groups in either the size or the direction of the paths that constitute the REM. Implications for REM theory and teaching practice are discussed.",130.0,The Reciprocal Effects Model Revisited: Extending Its Reach to Gifted Students Attending Academically Selective Schools,2015.0
"Cope and Grow: A Grounded Theory Approach to Early College Entrants' Lived Experiences and Changes in a STEM Program qualitative methodologies; social and; or emotional development and adjustment; student motivation In this grounded theory qualitative study, we interviewed 34 graduates from one cohort of 51 students from a prestigious early college entrance program in China. Based on the interview data, we identified distinct convergent and divergent patterns of lived experiences and changes. We found several dominant themes, including peers' mutual stimulation for excellence, academic competition, big-fish-little-pond effect, coping with academic challenges, transition to college life, developing intrinsic interests, and making critical career decisions. Based on the thematic analysis, we developed a Cope-and-Grow model of strivings for academic excellence while developing one's self-identity. Three interrelated claims are made about the unique situation in which early college entrants found themselves, individual differences in coping and growing experiences, and intrapersonal changes over time. Rich connections are made between the Cope-and-Grow model and the extant empirical research and theories, such as aptitude theory, developmental asynchrony theory, and talent development theory. We also discussed the implications of the findings for curricular and instructional adaptation, counseling interventions, and future research.",131.0,Cope and Grow: A Grounded Theory Approach to Early College Entrants' Lived Experiences and Changes in a STEM Program,2015.0
"Effects of Differentiated Reading on Elementary Students' Reading Comprehension and Attitudes Toward Reading differentiation; Schoolwide Enrichment Model-Reading; Title I; reading comprehension In this investigation, we examined the effects of a differentiated reading approach on fourth grade students' reading comprehension and attitudes toward reading. Eight Title I schools within one urban district were randomly assigned to treatment (Schoolwide Enrichment Model-Reading [SEM-R]) or control (district reading curriculum) conditions. Treatment teachers implemented SEM-R as a supplement to the district curriculum for 1 academic year, whereas control teachers used the district curriculum. Based on multilevel analyses of students' posttest reading comprehension scores on the Iowa Test of Basic Skills (n = 358) and attitudes toward reading as measured by the Elementary Reading Attitudes Survey (n = 429), no statistically significant differences in students' attitudes toward reading were found, but SEM-R students had significantly higher scores on the comprehension posttest compared with the students in the control schools.",132.0,Effects of Differentiated Reading on Elementary Students' Reading Comprehension and Attitudes Toward Reading,2015.0
"The Advocacy Experiences of Parents of Elementary Age, Twice-Exceptional Children twice exceptional; special populations/underserved gifted; special populations/underserved gifted; parents For many parents, successfully advocating for their twice-exceptional child can be intimidating and overwhelming. Using grounded theory, we conducted a study with parents (n = 8) of elementary age, twice-exceptional children to learn about their advocacy experiences. Findings revealed that parents simultaneously advocated for their child's disability and protected their child's giftedness. This overarching theme influenced parents' expectations of their local school system, while highlighting their lack of professional knowledge. All participants wanted their child to maximize her or his potential and not be limited by her or his disability. Data gathered from individual interviews and focus group sessions revealed that all parents struggled with developing advocacy strategies to manage their child's dual diagnosis. Only after parents acquired professional knowledge about educational terminology and official policies, were they able to become successful advocates. The lack of readily available resources focusing on twice-exceptional children was an obstacle to successful advocacy. Suggestions for future research and collaboration are discussed.",133.0,"The Advocacy Experiences of Parents of Elementary Age, Twice-Exceptional Children",2015.0
"Even the Best Have Difficulties: A Study of Finnish Straight-A Graduates' Resource-Oriented Solutions academic achievement; straight-A student; difficulties in studies; graduate; grades To achieve top scores, students need not only talents and study skills but also they have to conquer various adversities successfully. This research focused on the study paths, the concept adopted from Hickman, Bartholomew, Mathwig, and Heinrich (2008), of Finnish straight-A graduates in general upper secondary education. In this article, we refer to these paths with the concepts of study processes or just studies. The purpose was to analyze what kinds of difficulties these graduates had faced and how they coped with them. Researchers gathered data from 14 Finnish straight-A graduates by mailing a request to write an essay and by interviewing them. The results showed how the graduates' core difficulties were related to their peer relationships because of the gifted students' standing out from the crowd, pressure set by their own ambition, and the burden of wide-ranging interests. The graduates seemed to employ resource-oriented solutions when coping with adversities and difficultiesin this study, the solutions were divided into three dimensions. Based on the results, it is relevant to ask whether schools could support gifted students better by allowing mistakes and failures and supporting students to confront adversities by providing models and tools for survival. It is important to emphasize that failures and adversities are not a sign of weakness.",134.0,Even the Best Have Difficulties: A Study of Finnish Straight-A Graduates' Resource-Oriented Solutions,2015.0
"Life in the Fast Lane: Effects of Early Grade Acceleration on High School and College Outcomes acceleration; gifted; grade skipping; college outcomes; longitudinal analysis Research has repeatedly demonstrated the positive effects of acceleration for gifted and talented students. This study expands the literature by not only evaluating the impact of early grade skipping on high school and college outcomes but also examining the role of postacceleration opportunities on subsequent performance. Using a representative national sample, accelerated students were compared with older grade-level peers who had similar academic and demographic backgrounds. Results suggest that, on average, accelerated students consistently and significantly outperformed their nonaccelerated peers, both in high school and in college. Furthermore, postacceleration educational opportunities provided additional benefit; students who skipped a grade and also participated in challenging academic programs (e.g., Advanced Placement, high-ability instructional groups) demonstrated particularly high achievement. Results suggest that gifted learners profit most when acceleration is coupled with additional opportunities for advanced study.",135.0,Life in the Fast Lane: Effects of Early Grade Acceleration on High School and College Outcomes,2015.0
"Birthdate Effects and Gifted Program Participation in Kindergarten birthdate effects; gifted identification; kindergarten entry age Research has suggested that relatively older children are more likely to be identified as gifted and talented students compared with their younger peers. Such a phenomenon disadvantages the youngest students while at the same time confers additional advantages to the older students as a result of receiving specialized and/or extra instruction. The current study investigated the presence of this phenomenon on a national level using the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Cohort. Data were analyzed using multiple logistic regression analyses that accounted for the nested structure of the data and included student demographic variables as well as academic achievement skills as controls. Findings showed that even though a weak correlation indicated that relatively older students, on average, were more likely to be in a gifted and talented program, the association disappeared once academic achievement skills were accounted for.",136.0,Birthdate Effects and Gifted Program Participation in Kindergarten,2015.0
"A Comparison of Adolescents' Friendship Networks by Advanced Coursework Participation Status social and; or emotional development and adjustment; high school; age; developmental stage; hierarchical linear modeling; quantitative methodologies Friendships serve as a source of support and as a context for developing social competence. Although advanced coursework may provide a unique context for the development of friendships, more research is needed to explore exactly what differences exist. Using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health and the Adolescent Health and Academic Achievement Study, we compared the friendship networks of students taking advanced mathematics and English coursework to those of similar nonparticipants. Groups were compared on the number of sent or received nominations based on students' listings of friends, the presence and reciprocation of best friendships, and friends' academic engagement and diversity. Controlling for background, advanced coursework participants had larger networks and more engaged friends than did nonparticipants. Small differences in age heterogeneity and in the likelihood of reciprocal best friendships with female friends were found in English course-taking. Participants' networks were also somewhat less racially diverse.",137.0,A Comparison of Adolescents' Friendship Networks by Advanced Coursework Participation Status,2015.0
"Psychometric Properties of the School Attitude Assessment Survey-Revised With International Baccalaureate High School Students International Baccalaureate; confirmatory factor analysis In two studies (ns = 312 and 1,149) with 9- to 12-grade students in pre-International Baccalaureate (IB) and IB Diploma programs, we evaluated the reliability, factor structure, measurement invariance, and criterion-related validity of the scores from the School Attitude Assessment Survey-Revised (SAAS-R). Reliabilities of the five SAAS-R subscale scores were good (s > .80) for pre-IB (Grades 9-10) and IB students (Grades 11-12). Study 1 model fit indices for the five-factor SAAS-R model from confirmatory factor analyses showed greater misfit than those previously reported by McCoach and Siegle. In contrast, Study 2 fit indices for the five-factor model with pre-IB and IB students were similar to values reported by McCoach and Siegle. Tests of measurement invariance in Study 2 using multigroup confirmatory factor analysis identified three items within the Motivation/Self-Regulation subscale that differed in their item intercepts (i.e., uniform differential item functioning) with pre-IB students endorsing these items more strongly compared with IB students. Based on these results along with evidence of criterion-related validity as reflected in the moderate statistical relations between the SAAS-R subscales and students' GPAs, the SAAS-R shows promise as a research tool that can be used to examine the psychological factors associated with pre-IB and IB students' academic achievement.",138.0,Psychometric Properties of the School Attitude Assessment Survey-Revised With International Baccalaureate High School Students,2015.0
"Childhood Giftedness, Adolescent Agency: A Systemic Multiple-Case Study gifted; talented; child; development; motivation; adolescence; sensemaking; qualitative; parent; teacher Although considerable research has addressed development from childhood giftedness to adult excellence, subjective perceptions of this development by gifted individuals themselves have remained largely unexplored. This multiple case study examined the ways in which young adults, who in the past had been identified as gifted, made sense of their giftedness based on cues obtained from their social environment and the impact of this sensemaking on their development. Some participants made sense of their giftedness in a way that prevented them from developing a sense of agency in their education: Their sensemaking was based on social control or, conversely, on effortless learning and easy victories they experienced in childhood. The participants who showed the highest level of achievement and motivation in early adulthood perceived themselves as agents of their learning and made sense of their extraordinary outcomes as resulting from effortful, proper, and self-directed practice. Our findings indicate that a sense of agency is critical to maintaining gifted-level achievement through adolescence. We have identified some of the social environment factors that can diminish or enhance that sense of agency in high-achieving children.",139.0,"Childhood Giftedness, Adolescent Agency: A Systemic Multiple-Case Study",2015.0
