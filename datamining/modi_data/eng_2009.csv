"Parenting Gifted and Talented Children: Conceptual and Empirical Foundations parenting; Triple P; parenting programs; family intervention There is a paucity of research focusing on the needs of gifted children and their families, in particular, there is a lack of empirically supported parenting strategies to help parents in parenting their gifted child. This article provides an overview of the literature on difficulties experienced by parents of gifted and talented children, followed by a description of the development of a parenting program designed specifically for this population. Qualitative data from a survey of parents of gifted and talented children are presented to identify key themes for supporting and assisting parents. Gifted and Talented Triple P is a customized version of Triple P-Positive Parenting Program, consisting of nine sessions, specifically tailored for the needs of parents of gifted and talented children. The program is described and the clinical implications and future research directions in assisting parents in parenting their gifted and talented child are discussed.",285.0,Parenting Gifted and Talented Children: Conceptual and Empirical Foundations,2009.0
"Dimensionality and Typology of Perfectionism: The Use of the Frost Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale With Chinese Gifted Students in Hong Kong perfectionism; dimensions; perfectionist types; gifted students; Hong Kong This study investigated the dimensionality and typology of perfectionism based on the Frost Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale with a sample of 380 Chinese gifted students in Hong Kong. Confirmatory factor analyses supported a five-dimensional model that includes constructs of personal standards, parental expectations, parental criticism, concern over mistakes and doubts, and organization. Clustering procedures yielded three clusters of students interpreted as unhealthy perfectionists, healthy perfectionists, and nonperfectionists. Unhealthy perfectionists had pervasively high scores on all five dimensions, healthy perfectionists scored high on standards and organization and low on parental criticism and concern over mistakes and doubts, and nonperfectionists had pervasively low scores on all five dimensions. Implications of the findings for future research on perfectionism and the promotion of positive perfectionism are discussed.",286.0,Dimensionality and Typology of Perfectionism: The Use of the Frost Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale With Chinese Gifted Students in Hong Kong,2009.0
"The Impact of Advanced Curriculum on the Achievement of Mathematically Promising Elementary Students mathematics; curriculum; elementary; mathematically promising The primary aim of Project M-3: Mentoring Mathematical Minds was to develop and field test advanced units for mathematically promising elementary students based on exemplary practices in gifted and mathematics education. This article describes the development of the units and reports on mathematics achievement results for students in Grades 3 to 5 from I I urban and suburban schools after exposure to the curriculum. Data analyses indicate statistically significant differences favoring each of the experimental groups over the comparison group on the ITBS (Iowa Tests of Basic Skills) Concepts and Estimation Test and on Open-Response Assessments at all three grade levels. Furthermore, the effect sizes range from 0.29 to 0.59 on the ITBS Concepts and Estimation Scale and 0.69 to 0.97 on the Open-Response Assessments. These results indicate that these units, designed to address the needs of mathematically promising students, positively affected their achievement.",287.0,The Impact of Advanced Curriculum on the Achievement of Mathematically Promising Elementary Students,2009.0
"Self-Regulated Learning and Instructional Factors in the Scientific Inquiry of Scientifically Gifted Korean Middle School Students self-regulated learning; scientific iniquity; the scientifically gifted This correlational study investigated the direct and indirect effects of instructional factors and motivational and cognitive components of self-regulated learning on scientific inquiry performance in a sample of scientifically gifted middle school students. A total of 166 students were selected from nine gifted classes in the public school system with after-school enrichment programs in Korea. Students responded to self-report measures of mastery-oriented learning goals, self-efficacy, self-regulatory strategy use, and inquiry activities in science class. Performance data were obtained from work on a scientific inquiry task. Results of a path analysis revealed that Students' self-efficacy and perceived degree of inquiry activities in science class were the only factors directly influencing their scientific inquiry skills. Whereas open inquiry learning that allows for choices and decisions in students' inquiry procedure directly influenced use of self-regulatory strategies, the extent of inquiry activities directly influenced self-efficacy. Self-regulatory strategy use was not a significant predictor for scientific inquiry skills. Based on the results, implications for future science gifted education are discussed.",288.0,Self-Regulated Learning and Instructional Factors in the Scientific Inquiry of Scientifically Gifted Korean Middle School Students,2009.0

"Effect Sizes in Gifted Education Research Effect Size; Quantitative Methods; Statistical Significance; Gifted Education Research; Research Reporting Recent calls for reporting and interpreting effect sizes have been numerous, with the 5th edition of the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (2001) calling for the inclusion of effect sizes to interpret quantitative findings. Many top journals have required that effect sizes accompany claims of statistical significance. However, too often reports of data analyses in gifted education rely on statistical significance without reporting effect size indices to help interpret quantitative findings. Without a supporting effect size index, erroneous interpretation of results can occur. This Methodological Brief addresses this concern and provides examples and guidance concerning using effect sizes in gifted education quantitative research.",290.0,Effect Sizes in Gifted Education Research,2009.0
"Competitive Goal Orientations, Quality, and Stability in Gifted and Other Adolescents' Friendships A Test of Sullivan's Theory About the Harm Caused by Rivalry   Competitive goal orientations were rated by self, peers, and teachers for 38 gifted- and 38 regular-program, same-sex, friendship dyads (19 female and 19 male) from grades 7 and 8 (N = 152). Gifted dyads were reassessed on friendship quality and stability at the end of the school year and after the summer. Gifted students were more task-oriented and comparison students more other-referenced. Task-orientation was related to fewer friendship conflicts, more friendly competition, and, for gifted students, greater friendship stability. Being other-referenced was related to negative friendship qualities and unstable friendships regardless of sex, grade, or program, and instability in gifted female students' friendships. Friends reporting positive friendship qualities at the end of the school year more likely remained friends over the summer. Comparison group friendships had more numerous positive qualities (companionship, help, security, closeness) than those of gifted adolescents. Competitive goal orientation rather than competition itself affects friendship success.",291.0,"Competitive Goal Orientations, Quality, and Stability in Gifted and Other Adolescents' Friendships A Test of Sullivan's Theory About the Harm Caused by Rivalry",2009.0
"Profoundly Gifted Girls and Autism Spectrum Disorder A Psychometric Case Study Comparison Twice-exceptional; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Social Impairments, Profoundly Gifted A case study of the psychometric characteristics of two profoundly gifted girls, one with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and the other without ASD, is used to describe the nuances and subtleties most relevant in understanding the relationship between extreme giftedness and social difficulties. Through the presentation of the results from psychoeducational and psychosocial assessments, we demonstrate how data from a comprehensive evaluation can distinguish between the manifestation of extreme giftedness and concomitant social impairment indicative of ASD. Comparison of the assessment results highlights the relevance of cognitive and achievement information as well as the need for specific measures to diagnosis ASD. The girls demonstrated virtually identically superior cognitive and achievement performances. However, an in-depth analysis of additional measures, especially those specific to ASD, indicates that information about adaptive behavior and executive functioning can reveal important distinctions that are helpful in understanding the need for unique interventions specific to ASD.",292.0,Profoundly Gifted Girls and Autism Spectrum Disorder A Psychometric Case Study Comparison,2009.0
"Mother and Toddler Activity in the Zone of Proximal Development for Pretend Play as a Predictor of Higher Child IQ gifted; Zone of Proximal Development; pretend play; mother-child interactions This study investigated the pretend play of mother-toddler dyads in relation to later child IQ. Twenty-one toddlers were videotaped in monthly play sessions with their mothers, from age 8 to 17 months, and later assessed at 5 years of age on the Stanford-Binet IV. Children's and mothers' pretend play levels and frequencies were measured using Brown's (1997) Pretend Play Observation Scale. Dyadic play activity was analyzed using the conceptual frameworks of scaffolding and Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD). Toddlers later assessed as having higher IQ demonstrated more rapid teaming in the ZPD for pretend play and experienced earlier maternal transfer of responsibility for play. These findings support other evidence on the differential early development of high ability or gifted children and the role of caregiver interactions in that development.",293.0,Mother and Toddler Activity in the Zone of Proximal Development for Pretend Play as a Predictor of Higher Child IQ,2009.0
"Racial and Ethnic Representation in Gifted Programs Current Status of and Implications for Gifted Asian American Students Gifted; Race; Ethnicity; Asian American; Representation; Identification; Underrepresentation The Elementary and Secondary School Survey data and Civil Rights Data Collection of the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) were analyzed to describe the issue of overrepresentation of gifted Asian American students in gifted education programs in the United States. Nationally, Asian and Whites have been overrepresented in gifted education since 1978, whereas, students from other ethnic backgrounds, such as those from American Indian or Alaska Native, Hispanic, and African American groups, have been underrepresented with gradual increases in this underrepresentation since 1994. When the data were disaggregated by state for the period from 2002 to 2006, each racial and ethnic group displayed varied ranges of representation. Those varied distributions can be attributed to each state's unique demographic profile, varied definitions of giftedness, identification procedures, and identification policies. By focusing on Asian American students, this study addressed some difficulties that gifted Asian American students may face concerning the image of model minority and through the acculturation processes as immigrants or descendents of immigrants. Furthermore, this study suggests a need for disaggregated data collection and more research concerning gifted Asian American students from various ethnic Asian groups.",294.0,Racial and Ethnic Representation in Gifted Programs Current Status of and Implications for Gifted Asian American Students,2009.0
"Follow-Up With Students After 6 Years of Participation in Project EXCITE minority gifted students; Project EXCITE; achievement gap; advanced track Project EXCITE is a program for minority students that supplements the regular school offerings with an emphasis on enhancing students' interest and performance in math and science. This study examines the experience and perceptions of 14 student participants in the program and their parents. In student and parent interviews, Project EXCITE was deemed fun and challenging and as enabling the students to enrich and improve academic performance. A desire for placement in advanced academic settings and better preparation for schoolwork in high school motivated the students to persist in the program for 6 years. The perceptions of expanded social networks with high ability minority peers, enhanced social support for high achievement, and confidence to successfully compete academically with peers were other positive outcomes. Negative peer pressure was not identified as a concern, but balancing academic work and social interaction with peers outside the program was a major concern for students.",295.0,Follow-Up With Students After 6 Years of Participation in Project EXCITE,2009.0
"Protective Factors as Barriers to Depression in Gifted and Nongifted Adolescents gifted; depression; protective factors; psychosocial well-being; adolescents Despite continued efforts by researchers, a gap still exists in our understanding of the psychological, social, and emotional adjustment of gifted students. Historically, research and education of the gifted has focused on cognitive variables, with less attention given to the social and emotional needs of these students. The current study used data from the full Add Health data set to examine how protective factors moderated depression differently for gifted and nongifted adolescents. Results of the study indicate that gifted students are significantly less depressed than nongifted students, and all of the protective factors moderated depression for both groups. Future research should examine additional indicators of psychosocial well-being provide a more comprehensive framework for understanding the social and emotional development of gifted and nongifted adolescents.",296.0,Protective Factors as Barriers to Depression in Gifted and Nongifted Adolescents,2009.0
"Judging Drawing Abilities of Hong Kong Chinese Gifted Students: Could Nonexperts Make Expert-Like Judgments? visual arts talents; drawing abilities; expert judgments; Chinese Two drawings based on tasks originally used in Clark's Drawing Abilities Test from each of 297 Chinese students were first evaluated independently by two Chinese visual artists as below average, average, and above average in drawing abilities. Based on these judges' verbalization to make explicit their implicit criteria for judgments, a set of guidelines containing these criteria was developed for nonexpert or lay judges. The substantial and significant correlations between global ratings by lay judges and expert judges on the drawings of a separate sample of 105 students provided evidence that the guidelines were useful in helping nonexperts closely replicate expert judgments rendered by visual artists. Implications of the findings for the identification of visual arts talents in the school setting are discussed.",297.0,Judging Drawing Abilities of Hong Kong Chinese Gifted Students: Could Nonexperts Make Expert-Like Judgments?,2009.0
"Social Coping Among Academically Gifted Adolescents in a Residential Setting: A Longitudinal Study multivariate analyses; growth modeling; hierarchical linear modeling; structural equation modeling; qualitative methodologies; high school; age/developmental stage; social and/or emotional development and adjustment Much of the research on the social coping of students with gifts and talents has relied on a single administration of an instrument while the participants were attending a summer program. This study attempts to understand how attendance at a residential high school (academy) may affect academically gifted students over time. Students in two graduating classes at the academy completed the Social Coping Questionnaire on two (class of 2006) or three (class of 2005) occasions during their 2 years at the academy. Significant differences across approximately the first year at the academy are found for the items denying giftedness (more common after a year at the academy), social interaction (less common after a year at the academy), and peer acceptance (higher after a year at the academy).",298.0,Social Coping Among Academically Gifted Adolescents in a Residential Setting: A Longitudinal Study,2009.0
"A Longitudinal Study of Negative Life Events, Stress, and School Experiences of Gifted Youth gifted; negative life events; stress; achievement; qualitative An 11-year mixed-methods, cross-sectional longitudinal study began with a group of 121 children, identified as gifted, and followed them until high-school graduation. Parents annually identified negative life events experienced by child and family, and, at graduation, students completed an open-ended retrospective questionnaire, focusing on events, impact of events, supports, and hindrances during the school years. As a result of attrition, participants became increasingly homogeneous over time. School data were available for 59 students (of 63 family units who sustained involvement) at the end. The students had experienced many negative events and situations during the school years. However, they usually cited academic challenges, school transitions, peer relationships, and overcommitment as their most challenging experiences, not life events. Almost without exception, they maintained high achievement.",299.0,"A Longitudinal Study of Negative Life Events, Stress, and School Experiences of Gifted Youth",2009.0
"Self-Concept and Social Status of Accelerated and Nonaccelerated Students in the First 2 Years of Secondary School in the Netherlands self-concept; social status; academic acceleration; secondary school This study examined the self-concept and social status of accelerated and nonaccelerated students in their first 2 years of secondary school in the Netherlands. In 357 students from 18 secondary schools, we measured self-concept, sociometric status, and behavior reputations at three times. Accelerated students had more positive self-concepts concerning school in general and mathematics than nonaccelerated students, but a less positive social self-concept. In girls but not in boys, the difference in social self-concept of accelerated and nonaccelerated students was no longer present at the end of the 2nd year. Accelerated students had a lower social status than nonaccelerants and were considered to be less cooperative, humorous, helpful, leading, and social. peer ratings were more negative for accelerated boys than for accelerated girls. Implications for the education of accelerated students, including the social emotional development of accelerated students in their 1st years of secondary school, are discussed.",300.0,Self-Concept and Social Status of Accelerated and Nonaccelerated Students in the First 2 Years of Secondary School in the Netherlands,2009.0
