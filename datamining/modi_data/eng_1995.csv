"THE EFFECTS OF AN ENRICHMENT PROGRAM ON THE FAMILIES OF PARTICIPANTS - A MULTIPLE-CASE STUDY   The effects of an enrichment program on the families of participating students were explored in this discovery-oriented, retrospective, multiple-case study. The enrichment program investigated was a pull out program based on the Purdue Three-Stage Model that helped identified gifted and talented elementary children develop creative and critical thinking, problem solving, and independent learning skills (Feldhusen and Kolloff, 1978, 1986). Criterion-based selection procedures were used to select the participants (ten families of high school seniors who had participated in the program for at least three years in elementary school). Data were collected through family interviews, questionnaires, and archival records, and were analyzed by inductive, constant-comparative procedures (Glaser and Strauss, 1967; Goetz and LeCompte, 1984; Strauss and Corbin, 1990) and by data displays (Miles and Huberman, 1994). The findings suggest that, in most cases, the program had a positive influence on both family relationships and home-school relationships.",708.0,THE EFFECTS OF AN ENRICHMENT PROGRAM ON THE FAMILIES OF PARTICIPANTS - A MULTIPLE-CASE STUDY,1995.0
"IDENTIFYING ACADEMIC POTENTIAL IN STUDENTS FROM UNDER-REPRESENTED POPULATIONS - IS USING THE RAVENS PROGRESSIVE MATRICES A GOOD IDEA   Increasing concern has been focused on the under-representation of African-American and Hispanic students in programs for the academically talented. The Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) has been suggested as a possible instrument to help remedy this situation, although little research has been conducted about its viability in identifying academic potential in minority populations. A sample of low-income minority students was given the Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices (APM) along with a more traditional measure of academic aptitude (The School and College Ability Test) to compare the ability of each to identify students who might profit from advanced-level coursework. There were differences among ethnic groups in results of both tests, but a significantly higher proportion of minority children scored at a high level on the RPM than on the traditional measure. In addition, the RPM does appear to be a useful instrument for identifying academic potential in students with limited English proficiency. However, there are still issues and concerns surrounding the use of the APM as the sole instrument for selecting students to participate in special programs stressing high-level academic standards and content. The RPM appears to hold more promise as a general screening instrument to be used in conjunction with other measures to identify students with academic potential who could profit from special programs designed to enhance their academic skills.",709.0,IDENTIFYING ACADEMIC POTENTIAL IN STUDENTS FROM UNDER-REPRESENTED POPULATIONS - IS USING THE RAVENS PROGRESSIVE MATRICES A GOOD IDEA,1995.0
"DEPRESSION AND SUICIDAL IDEATION AMONG ACADEMICALLY GIFTED ADOLESCENTS   Depression and suicidal ideation among academically gifted adolescents, exceptionally gifted adolescents, and adolescents average in academic performance were examined. No significant differences were detected among the three groups in level, severity, or nature of distress experienced. Results are discussed in light of the supportive interventions appropriate for high school students and the need for further research with subgroups of gifted students more likely to experience psychological distress.",710.0,DEPRESSION AND SUICIDAL IDEATION AMONG ACADEMICALLY GIFTED ADOLESCENTS,1995.0
"REVERSING UNDERACHIEVEMENT - CREATIVE PRODUCTIVITY AS A SYSTEMATIC INTERVENTION   This study combined qualitative and quantitative methodology in a multiple case study to examine the phenomenon of underachievement and the effect of using creative productivity (Type III) enrichment as a systematic intervention in reversing the pattern. Twelve teachers who received training in the Enrichment Triad Model selected 17 students identified as gifted who were also underachieving in their school performance. The 17 students, ages 8-13, included five girls and twelve boys. All students were guided through a Type III study by their referring teacher during one school year. Questionnaires, interest surveys, interviews, product evaluation, and participant observations provided information about individual students in the context of pursuing Type III investigations. The findings regarding the use of creative productivity to address underachievement were numerous. First, a variety of factors contributed to the underachievement of students with high academic potential including: emotional issues (dysfunctional families); social and behavioral issues (the influence of an inappropriate peer group); the lack of an appropriate curriculum (students not motivated by the regular curriculum); and a suspected learning disability or poor self-regulation. The most compelling finding of this research study was the positive gains made by the students through their involvement in the Type III intervention. Eighty-two percent of the students made positive gains during the course of the year and in the year following the intervention. Most were no longer underachieving in their school settings at the end of the intervention. Five aspects of the process evolved as important foci for different groups of students: 1) the relationship with the teacher; 2) presentation of self-regulation strategies, 3) opportunity to investigate their own issue of underachievement, 4) the opportunity to work on an area of interest in their preferred learning style and 5) the opportunity to interact with an appropriate peer group.",711.0,REVERSING UNDERACHIEVEMENT - CREATIVE PRODUCTIVITY AS A SYSTEMATIC INTERVENTION,1995.0
"RELATIONS BETWEEN ACADEMIC APTITUDE AND PSYCHOSOCIAL ADJUSTMENT IN GIFTED PROGRAM STUDENTS   Is high academic aptitude an asset or a liability to psychosocial adjustment among gifted program students? This brief report examined contrasting hypotheses that the relation between academic aptitude and psychosocial adjustment is positive, negative, or curvilinear for high ability students. Robustness of study findings was examined in three diverse groups of gifted program students: 1) 151 second grade students participating in public school gifted programs; 2) 264 5th to 11th grade students attending a university summer enrichment program; and 3) 60 adolescent females enrolled in an early college entrance program. Psychosocial adjustment was assessed by measures of academic, social, and general self-concept in all three groups, with additional adjustment measures specific to each group. Results of hierarchical multiple regression analyses provided little evidence for a relation between aptitude scores and adjustment within this restricted range.",712.0,RELATIONS BETWEEN ACADEMIC APTITUDE AND PSYCHOSOCIAL ADJUSTMENT IN GIFTED PROGRAM STUDENTS,1995.0

"THE EXPERIENCE OF GIFTEDNESS - A CONCEPT MAP   Gifted students' written responses to a phenomenological probe (i.e., ''What is it like to be gifted?'') were qualitatively reduced to a set of exhaustive and representative items. Students then performed free card sorts on these items, which they also rated for application to them. Multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis of students' sorts suggest positive and negative elements of the experience of giftedness along internal and interpersonal dimensions. We conclude with implications of our findings for research and teaching with gifted adolescents.",717.0,THE EXPERIENCE OF GIFTEDNESS - A CONCEPT MAP,1995.0
"CONSEQUENCES OF HAVING A GIFTED SIBLING - MYTHS AND REALITIES   Three hundred sixty-six triads, each including a mother and her only two children, ages 7-14, completed questionnaires targeting mental ability and school achievement, child adjustment, and sibling relationship variables. Triads had been chosen as having 0, 1, or 2 children who were eligible for special classes for highly capable students. Except for academic-ability variables, group comparisons according to school-based categories were not suggestive of sibling-giftedness effects. To focus on within-family perceptions, pairs were reclassified using a median split of the first principal component of maternal perceptions of child's giftedness. Contrary to findings of most previous studies, both giftedness and having a gifted sibling were generally associated with more favorable responses by children and mothers. Gender and age effects were also examined.",718.0,CONSEQUENCES OF HAVING A GIFTED SIBLING - MYTHS AND REALITIES,1995.0
"THE PARSONAGE CHILDREN - AN ANALYSIS OF THE CREATIVE EARLY YEARS OF THE BRONTES AT HAWORTH   This paper analyzes the evolving creative development of the young Brontes at Haworth Parsonage in England during the first half of the nineteenth century. The author concludes that by closely examining the early years of eminent individuals we are better able to analyze those qualities, behaviors, and events that describe the process of talent development. In the case of the Brontes, one is able to study a family of exceptional talent and to reflect on the significance of the role of parents, collaborative siblings, and the natural environment in the nourishing and sustaining of that talent. This paper focuses on the education of the Brontes and on the ''little books'' that they started to produce in abundance when they were young and continued to write into adolescence.",719.0,THE PARSONAGE CHILDREN - AN ANALYSIS OF THE CREATIVE EARLY YEARS OF THE BRONTES AT HAWORTH,1995.0
"AN EMPIRICAL-INVESTIGATION OF THE SOCIAL COPING STRATEGIES USED BY GIFTED ADOLESCENTS   The formation of an identity during adolescence is believed to be facilitated by conformity to others and membership in a peer group. Because gifted adolescents in a typical school setting often experience difficulties in conformity and peer group membership, they can be expected to face some unique challenges during adolescence. The current study seeks empirical evidence for discrete strategies that gifted adolescents may use to cope with perceived social difficulties. Highly gifted students who were identified by the Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth and who participated in a rigorous summer academic program completed a survey that was specifically designed to reflect coping strategies proposed in the literature. The results of the survey were factor analyzed and yielded five meaningful factors: denial of giftedness, popularity/conformity, peer acceptance, fear of failure, and activity level. The results of the factor analysis suggest that further research focusing on the measurement of social coping strategies among gifted adolescents is warranted.",720.0,AN EMPIRICAL-INVESTIGATION OF THE SOCIAL COPING STRATEGIES USED BY GIFTED ADOLESCENTS,1995.0
"TALENT IGNORED, TALENT DIVERTED - THE CULTURAL-CONTEXT UNDERLYING GIFTEDNESS IN FEMALES   This article presents the results of a study of 67 gifted females enrolled in graduate programs in education at a large state university. These women completed a questionnaire about various aspects of their lives including their education and family life; parental encouragement; career, personal, and professional achievements; and the effects of marriage and children on their lives. Follow-up interviews were conducted with 25 of the women. results indicate that the majority of these gifted females believe that their parents encouraged them to go to college but not to pursue a specific career, and many were unsure about whether they had selected the right career. Almost half of the women indicated that barriers existed to their own talent development because of their marriage and personal lives. Many of the women in this study were unsure about whether they were satisfied with their lives because of their continuing attempts to pursue their own talents while maintaining their personal lives. The majority of the women in this study had extremely limited time to pursue their own talents. The study summarizes some of the continuing dilemmas facing gifted females, and in particular, explores some of the issues confronting gifted females who pursue careers, even those generally considered traditional for women.",721.0,"TALENT IGNORED, TALENT DIVERTED - THE CULTURAL-CONTEXT UNDERLYING GIFTEDNESS IN FEMALES",1995.0
THE POWER OF SPECIALIZED EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENTS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF GIFTEDNESS - THE NEED FOR RESEARCH ON SOCIAL-CONTEXT   The paper argues that educators of the gifted have overlooked important evidence on the power of special environments because of our habit of considering cognitive outcomes and an outsider view of evidence as the standard for judging the benefits of special environments. The author proposes that social context be used as a construct to help rethink how to study the benefits of special environments.,722.0,THE POWER OF SPECIALIZED EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENTS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF GIFTEDNESS - THE NEED FOR RESEARCH ON SOCIAL-CONTEXT,1995.0

"GIFTED EDUCATION AT A CROSSROADS - THE PROGRAM STATUS STUDY   The program status study was designed to examine the status of local programs for students with high abilities and the reasons to which educators and key personnel attributed the status of these programs. This descriptive ex post facto research, completed in a purposive sample of 19 states, was completed in two phases. Phase 1 included a mail survey to approximately 3,000 local teachers, coordinators, and/or principals who were responsible for programs for students with high abilities. Phase 2 included interviews with key personnel (state directors of gifted education, presidents of state advocacy organizations, school superintendents, chairpersons of local boards) and was designed to triangulate the findings from Phase 1. Results indicated that programs in states with mandates and in good economic health are intact and expanded; programs in all other groups of states (states with mandates and in poor economic health, states without mandates and in good economic health, states without mandates in poor economic health) are being threatened, reduced, and eliminated. More than half of the respondents from states with mandates and in good economic health attributed their expanded or intact status to the mandate and advocacy efforts. About half of the districts from states without mandates attributed their jeopardized status to a decline in state and local funds.",729.0,GIFTED EDUCATION AT A CROSSROADS - THE PROGRAM STATUS STUDY,1995.0
"PERCEPTIONS OF EDUCATIONAL-REFORM BY EDUCATORS REPRESENTING MIDDLE SCHOOLS, COOPERATIVE LEARNING, AND GIFTED EDUCATION   The present article describes the results of two surveys comparing the perceptions of educators of gifted students with the perceptions of mainstream educational personnel in middle schools and those specializing in cooperative learning. The results indicated a major gulf between the perceptions of mainstream educators and those of educators of the gifted. In the case of middle schools, the disagreement focused on the value of ability grouping and the social consequences of being labeled gifted. In the case of cooperative learning, there were major differences across the board on practically all items. The authors conclude that it is in the interest of all concerned to have more extensive dialogue between educators of the gifted and members of the educational reform movement.",730.0,"PERCEPTIONS OF EDUCATIONAL-REFORM BY EDUCATORS REPRESENTING MIDDLE SCHOOLS, COOPERATIVE LEARNING, AND GIFTED EDUCATION",1995.0
"DECIDING TO DIFFERENTIATE INSTRUCTION IN MIDDLE SCHOOL - ONE SCHOOLS JOURNEY   As many schools move toward serving a broad range of students in heterogeneous settings, it is important to assist teachers in developing classrooms responsive to the needs of academically diverse learners. Understanding what impedes and what facilitates appropriately differentiated instruction is essential for educational leaders if schools are to move away from one-size-fits-all teaching and if heterogeneous classrooms are to become viable for ''academic outliers'' such as gifted, struggling, and special education learners. This case study examines the experience of one middle school confronted with a district mandate for differentiated instruction and presents the factors which impeded or facilitated their movement toward appropriately differentiated classrooms.",731.0,DECIDING TO DIFFERENTIATE INSTRUCTION IN MIDDLE SCHOOL - ONE SCHOOLS JOURNEY,1995.0
"WHAT DO WE MEAN BY GIFTEDNESS - A PENTAGONAL IMPLICIT THEORY   This article presents a pentagonal implicit theory of giftedness and a set of data testing the theory. The exposition is divided into five parts. First, we discuss what an implicit theory is and why such theories are important. Second, we describe the pentagonal theory, specifying five conditions claimed to be individually necessary and jointly sufficient for a person to be labeled as gifted. These conditions help us understand not only why some people are labeled as gifted but also why some others are not. Third, we consider the relation of the pentagonal theory to explicit theories of giftedness. Fourth, we present data supporting the theory. Finally, we discuss some implications of the pentagonal theory for gifted education.",732.0,WHAT DO WE MEAN BY GIFTEDNESS - A PENTAGONAL IMPLICIT THEORY,1995.0
