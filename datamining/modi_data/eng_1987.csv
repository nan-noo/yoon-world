"RAMPANT PROBLEMS AND PROMISING PRACTICES IN THE IDENTIFICATION OF DISADVANTAGED GIFTED STUDENTS   Identifying disadvantaged gifted children is a critical issue for the field of education for the gifted. The purposes of this article are to define problems in the identification of disadvantaged gifted students and to describe promising practices that identify students with gifted potential among various groups of disadvantaged students. These are issues of theoretical importance, and they have implications for practice in terms of equity in services offered and advocacy for programs for the gifted.",1017.0,RAMPANT PROBLEMS AND PROMISING PRACTICES IN THE IDENTIFICATION OF DISADVANTAGED GIFTED STUDENTS,1987.0
"THE RURAL GIFTED-CHILD   The effects of such characteristics as rural living, sparse population, poverty, non-urban acculturation experiences, and traditional rural values are related to the difficulties in providing for the educational needs of rural gifted students. Some promising solutions to these problems are suggested. Included are non-traditional identification procedures, computer and video linkages between school systems, cooperative personnel development, and sharing of special service staffs for the gifted.",1018.0,THE RURAL GIFTED-CHILD,1987.0
"THE GIFTED LEARNING-DISABLED STUDENT   As the identification of learning disabled and gifted students becomes more sophisticated, there appears to be a growing number of students who fit both categories. This article discusses the identification of learning disabled and gifted students as well as the characteristics of a group which has gotten little attention, the gifted/LD. The ways in which gifted/learning disabled students are presently missed by educational systems as well as procedures to help insure identification of this group are also covered.",1019.0,THE GIFTED LEARNING-DISABLED STUDENT,1987.0
"THE EARLY DEVELOPMENT OF PRECOCITY   The time is ripe for extending our interest in gifted children downward to infancy and preschool. Existing research is reviewed, and a plea made for extending work in the following areas: (1) identification and description, (2) prediction from early behavior to (similar or dissimilar) later attainments, (3) studies of the origins of commitment and high achievement motivation, (4) naturalistic and experimental studies of the nurturance of exceptional abilities. Gifted babies and toddlers are compelling both in their own right and for what they can tell us about the emergence of individual differences.",1020.0,THE EARLY DEVELOPMENT OF PRECOCITY,1987.0
A DEVELOPMENTAL VIEW OF GIFTEDNESS   Our most precious resources for the future of our society are human resources. We made an important commitment of scientific talent and financial support about 25 years ago to enhancing the developmental potential of the retarded among us. The progress in this area has been gratifying. A concomitant commitment has not been made to understanding the developmental potential of the gifted among us. The time is past due for that commitment. It is important to draw out the developmental issues related to the gifted and the talented in such a way as to frame productive scientific questions. The model presented in this essay has been used to frame such a set of questions.,1021.0,A DEVELOPMENTAL VIEW OF GIFTEDNESS,1987.0
A 3-YEAR STUDY OF THE EFFECTS OF LOW INCOME ON SAT SCORES AMONG THE ACADEMICALLY ABLE   This study reports on the incidence of economically disadvantaged gifted learners in the midwest and the differential effects of low income on their SAT scores when compared to higher income students. It presents data supporting the conclusion that low income impedes the gifted student from being able to take advantage of special programs outside of his or her school district and negatively affects test scores even in the upper ranges of ability. Ideas for combating the differential scoring pattern of low income students are discussed along with implications for school district and state policy development.,1022.0,A 3-YEAR STUDY OF THE EFFECTS OF LOW INCOME ON SAT SCORES AMONG THE ACADEMICALLY ABLE,1987.0
"BRINGING OUT HEAD-START TALENTS - FINDINGS FROM THE FIELD   The purpose of this project was to address the need for identifying and providing programming for potentially gifted Head Start children. Four hundred forty-six Head Start children, 32 teachers, and 32 teacher aides participated in the field-testing and were divided into intervention and comparison groups. The comparison group was made up of 212 children, 20 teachers, and 20 teacher aides, and the intervention group included 234 children, 12 teachers, and 12 teacher aides. All children in both groups received programming to enhance divergent, convergent, and evaluative thinking skills. Children with special gifts and talents in both groups were identified and those in the intervention group received programming in their talent area. Results indicated that both indentified and non-identified potentially gifted children in the intervention group made significant gains over the comparison group in cognitive and creative functioning. In addition, attitudes of teachers in the intervention group toward their classes became significantly more positive than attitudes of teachers in the comparison group.",1023.0,BRINGING OUT HEAD-START TALENTS - FINDINGS FROM THE FIELD,1987.0
"IM BLACK BUT LOOK AT ME, I AM ALSO GIFTED   The lack of representation of black gifted children in educational programs for the gifted is a cause for great concem. Historical precedents and lack of empirical data on appropriate identification processes and educational planning techniques have been noted as part of the reason for the lack. A discussion of research data to date indicates that observation techniques, community involvement, and peer, parent, and teacher nominations are viable techniques to use in identifying the black gifted child. The data also show that leadership skills, creativity, and mental processing abilities, are good indicators of giftedness among the black students. Identification, curriculum, the instructional environment (teacher, setting, strategies), and evaluation are discussed as important aspects of a total plan for the black gifted child. Alternatives for program planning are recommended.",1024.0,"IM BLACK BUT LOOK AT ME, I AM ALSO GIFTED",1987.0

"ACCELERATIVE STRATEGIES - HOW EFFECTIVE ARE THEY FOR THE GIFTED   Accelerative strategies offer gifted students the opportunity to participate in educational programs suited to their particular needs and interests. Yet, fear of possible negative effects of acceleration prevents many educators from advocating these options. The Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth (SMPY) has evaluated the long-term effects of a variety of accelerative options for a group of highly gifted students. Academic achievements, extracurricular activities, goals and aspirations, and social and emotional adjustment were considered, and no discernible negative effects of various accelerative strategies were found.",1028.0,ACCELERATIVE STRATEGIES - HOW EFFECTIVE ARE THEY FOR THE GIFTED,1987.0
"THE ROLE OF COMMUNITY-BASED SCIENTIFIC RESOURCES IN DEVELOPING SCIENTIFIC TALENT - A CASE-STUDY   This article explores key components of a science program for gifted learners and provides a two year experimental program as a case study to illustrate the implementation of these components. The findings illustrate the efficiency of science content mastery in the context of scientific inquiry, the relative difficulty of demonstrating growth in scientific inquiry per se over a short period of time, and the affective changes that occur in attitudes toward science as a result of such a program. Implications for implementing such programs in local settings are discussed.",1029.0,THE ROLE OF COMMUNITY-BASED SCIENTIFIC RESOURCES IN DEVELOPING SCIENTIFIC TALENT - A CASE-STUDY,1987.0
"A CURRENT REPORT ON GRADUATE DEGREE PROGRAMS IN GIFTED AND TALENTED EDUCATION   Since the closing of the U.S. Office of Gifted and Talented, there has existed a need for information on professional training programs in the education of the gifted. In spring 1984, the authors offered their first directory of graduate degree programs in gifted education. Recent requests from state directors, psychologists, university faculty, prospective graduate students, and others have indicated a need for an update of this information. The current search revealed that 134 colleges and universities in 42 states and the District of Columbia offered such programs. All reported programs are listed in the 1986-87 directory, along with the appropriate contact persons and their addresses.",1030.0,A CURRENT REPORT ON GRADUATE DEGREE PROGRAMS IN GIFTED AND TALENTED EDUCATION,1987.0

"THE GENERALITY OF CREATIVE PERFORMANCE IN GIFTED AND NONGIFTED CHILDREN   In order to evaluate the generality of creativity, gifted and nongifted children (N = 228) were given a creative performance questionnaire. Questionnaires were scored for quality and quantity in seven performance domains: writing, music, crafts, art, science, performing arts, and public presentation. The generality of performance was tested by checking the intercorrelations of the seven domains. Results indicated that the quality and quantity of creative performance were largely unrelated, and differences between gifted and nongifted children were slight. Additionally, for both gifted and nongifted children, quantity performance scores of the seven domains were significantly correlated (median r= .46), and quality performance scores were only weakly correlated (median r=.16).",1032.0,THE GENERALITY OF CREATIVE PERFORMANCE IN GIFTED AND NONGIFTED CHILDREN,1987.0
"THE STABILITY OF ORIGINAL THINKING IN YOUNG-CHILDREN   Findings from the longitudinal study demonstrate that original thinking in young children (N = 33, 75 to 98 mo.) is relatively stable between 4 and ages 7 and 8. The stability of original thinking (r = .54) was comparable to the stability of 1Q ( r # .44) over the same period of time. Original thinking defined as the ability to generate unusual ideas was shown to be distinct from intelligence as measured by the Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children-Revised. An order effect in the response sequence such that popular responses occur early and original later, reported in an earlier study with young children, was also replicated.",1033.0,THE STABILITY OF ORIGINAL THINKING IN YOUNG-CHILDREN,1987.0
"INTELLIGENCE SCORES OF GIFTED STUDENTS ON THE WISC-R   In order to examine the hypothesis that children identified as ""gifted"" may have different patterns of scores on the WISC-R than children not identified as ""gifted"", the present study examined the WISC-R scores of three groups of children: those scoring in the average range, those with high IQ's, and those identified as ""gifted."" Factor analysis conducted on a sample of children identified as ""gifted"" yielded a four-factor solution accounting for approximately 65% of the total variance: Perceptual Organization, Verbal Comprehension, Acquisition of Knowledge, and Spatial Memory. Analyses of groups of children with average and above average intelligence scores revealed two- and three-factor solutions for the average children, but a pattern similar to the gifted child for the high IQ group. Results suggest that gifted children process information in a qualitatively different manner from average children.",1034.0,INTELLIGENCE SCORES OF GIFTED STUDENTS ON THE WISC-R,1987.0
"IDENTIFICATION OF GIFTED LEARNERS - A NATIONAL SURVEY OF ASSESSMENT PRACTICES AND TRAINING NEEDS OF SCHOOL-PSYCHOLOGISTS   This study surveyed assessment practices and training needs of school psychologists involving gifted individuals. Using stratified random sampling procedure, a sample of practicing school psychologists was selected from the national register of the National Association of School Psychologists. A survey questionnaire containing 20 items relating to the uses of individual ability and achievement tests was mailed to the group. An analysis of responses indicated that the Wechsler Scales ranked first despite newly developed available tests. Results also indicated a number of training needs related to assessment the implications of which are discussed.",1035.0,IDENTIFICATION OF GIFTED LEARNERS - A NATIONAL SURVEY OF ASSESSMENT PRACTICES AND TRAINING NEEDS OF SCHOOL-PSYCHOLOGISTS,1987.0

"A 50-YEAR FOLLOW-UP OF TERMANS YOUNGEST COLLEGE-STUDENTS AND IQ-MATCHED AGEMATES   The 19 youngest college students in Terman's classic longitudinal study were compared with others of the same approximate age and IQ on academic and career progress and psychosocial adjustment. The young college students earned higher grades, more academic honors, and participated in more extracurrcular activities. They graduated and entered the professions earlier, and were, in 1940, more often rated as ""high achievers,"" although this qualitative difference had disappeared by 1960.

"FAMILY ENVIRONMENT AND PERSONALITY ADJUSTMENT IN GIFTED PROGRAM CHILDREN   While many studies have investigated family characteristics that distinguish children with gifted-level abili- ties from other children, less attention has been given to family characteristics that are associated with personality adjustment within the gifted- level poupulation. This study addresses the question of which aspects of the family environmentare are significantly correlated with healthy personality adjustment among a group of children already identified as gifted. Each of the 10 scales contained in the widely used Family Environment Scales (Moos & Moos, 1981) was correlated with personality adjustment scores of 83 children, ages 7 to 11, who were attending either a public or private school gifted program. Personality adjustment was assessed by parent, child, and teacher report measures. Findings suggest that mutually supportive and open family relationships are more important to the child's self- esteem and overall adjustment that are specific family activities or value orientations.",1040.0,FAMILY ENVIRONMENT AND PERSONALITY ADJUSTMENT IN GIFTED PROGRAM CHILDREN,1987.0
"PERSONALITY-TRAITS AND CHILDHOOD ENVIRONMENTS OF EMINENT ESSAYISTS   The goal of the research was to define conditions of excellence by an historical analysis of the psychological traits and childhood environments of eminent essayists of history. A sample of 42 foremost essayists, historians, and critics was used. The sample was derived from earlier work on eminence by Cattell (1903) and Terman (1925). Encyclopaedia Britannica biographers and other researchers rated a list of traits and conditions concerning cognitive, affective, familiar, and educational aspect of the sample. The results of Chi-square tests of significance focus on the degree of persistence of the traits and conditions and suggest that while intelligence is a component of eminence, environmental influences are substantial. Familial, school, and social conditions reticulated an indispensable support during the childhoods of the future essayists.

"REACTIONS TO FAILURE AND SUCCESS AMONG GIFTED, AVERAGE, AND EMR STUDENTS   This investigation was designed to examine the reactions of gifted students, and to a lesser extent, those of average and EMR students, to success and failure in the school setting. Attributions, persistence of effort following a failure, willingness to attempt a task following failure, as well as future expectations for success were explored. Students were assessed in two conditions in which success and failure were manipulated. Results indicated that gifted students did not credit success to ability as predicted, but instead to a low level of task difficulty. The expectations of gifted students were very high initially, but considereably lower following a failure, as were those of the average and EMR groups. Gifted students showed more persistence in regard to the difficult task than EMR students and also chose more often to repeat the difficult task.",1042.0,"REACTIONS TO FAILURE AND SUCCESS AMONG GIFTED, AVERAGE, AND EMR STUDENTS",1987.0

The results of the study show that the long-term effects of the gifted label are in part a reverse of the reported immediate effects. Research on immediate effects indicates difficulties for non-labeled siblings. Long-term effects indicate that siblings ""came to terms"" with the label and did not seem to harbor negative feelings or recollections. While the families reported an overall positive attitude towards the gifted member, it was the gifted member who seemed less certain of the positive feelings of siblings and parents regarding the label.",1043.0,LABELING GIFTED YOUNGSTERS - LONG-TERM IMPACT ON FAMILIES,1987.0

Additional personality and behavioral information on each child was provided by his/her mother and teacher. Giftedness seemed to be an advantage for girls but not for boys. Gifted girls described themselves as having a more positive self-concept and a more internal locus of control than did non-gifted girls. No such differences were found with boys. In fact, gifted boys gave some evidence of lower self-satisfaction, particularly in areas of physical strength and aggressiveness, when compared to non-gifted boys. Mothers and teachers similarly reported fewer problem areas for gifted girls but no such differences between gifted and non-gifted boys.
