"A psychological autopsy of the suicide of an academically gifted student: Researchers' and parents' perspectives   This study uses the methods and procedures of psychological autopsy to portray the life of an academically gifted college student who completed suicide. The study is unique in that it follows the subject across his 21 years of life, highlighting relevant milestones and significant stages and events. A comprehensive view of the life and death of a gifted student is offered through both researchers' and parents' perspectives, along with multiple theoretical explanations, including a developmental explanation. This psychological autopsy yielded three sets of findings: those that reflected exclusively on the subject's life, those that compare his life with 3 previous psychological autopsies conducted, and those that reflect the parents' observations and experiences of his life. Two important findings of this study include a depiction of the psychological makeup of a subject in interaction with his environment and the fact that many of the factors contributing to suicidal behavior identified for the general population of adolescents and young adults existed in this case, as well. Consequently, as Cross, Cook, and Dixon (1996) found, certain types of aberrant behavior, belief systems, or both should not be considered a typical part of being a gifted person; they should be recognized as potential indicators of suicidal behavior.",485.0,A psychological autopsy of the suicide of an academically gifted student: Researchers' and parents' perspectives,2002.0
"The theory of successful intelligence as a basis for gifted education   A number of models are available for use in gifted education. The theory of successful intelligence, one such model, provides a basis for identification, intervention, and evaluation in gifted programs. This article descries the model, allowing practitioners and other interested parties to apply the model in a gifted education environment. The article contains four main parts. The first part presents the theory of successful intelligence and data in support of it. The second part shows how to implement the model in schools and presents data in support of the success of its school implementation. The third part relates the theory of successful intelligence to other models of gifted education. The fourth part briefly draws some conclusions.",486.0,The theory of successful intelligence as a basis for gifted education,2002.0
"Family factors associated with high academic competence in former head start children at third grade   Most studies of gifted students have looked at already identified groups, often convenience samples. This study takes a more epidemiological approach. Of the 5,400 children in the National Head Start/Public School Early Childhood Transition Demonstration Project tested at the end of third grade, the highest achieving 3% (N = 162) were selected by conducting a principal components analysis on their scores on the vocabulary and achievement measures. Compared with the remaining children, the high-achieving Children were thriving both socially and academically, and, although as a group they were not enamoured of school, fewer were strongly disaffected. On the whole, the families of these children had somewhat more resources on which to call and somewhat fewer stresses with which to deal than the families of the remaining children, although their mean income was only 1.26 times the Poverty Index. Compared to caretakers of the remaining children, caretakers of high achievers ascribed to more positive parenting attitudes and were seen by teachers as more strongly encouraging their children's progress. Of the 113 third-grade high achievers with test scores at grades 1, 2, and 3, 52 had met the 3% criterion in at least 2 grades, and 37 had done so in all 3. Years of high achievement correlated with family resources. These findings demonstrate that even families sorely stressed by life circumstances can support very positive intellectual and social competence in their children.",487.0,Family factors associated with high academic competence in former head start children at third grade,2002.0
"Shaping an identity: Factors influencing the achievement of newly married, gifted young women   This article describes the experiences of 3 gifted women who had recently graduated from college and were beginning to shape their professional identities. Through a qualitative case study approach, this study examined the factors influencing the sample's professional achievements. Major findings include each of the participants attributing a significant part of her identity to her status as a high achiever. This identity was influenced primarily by 3 factors: foundational influences, personality characteristics, and marriage as a partnership. The foundational influences were instrumental in shaping and directing the high-achieving component of the participants' identities. Specific attributes of their personalities provided the women with the tools necessary to transform their drive to achieve into actual accomplishments. Finally, defining their marriages as partnerships allowed each of them to view her identity in relation to another person and create a partnership that would empower both partners to achieve their goals. Implications of the findings are presented with suggestions for parents and educators that may help foster achievement in young gifted women.",488.0,"Shaping an identity: Factors influencing the achievement of newly married, gifted young women",2002.0
"Bridging the gap: A tool and technique to analyze and evaluate gifted education curricular units   Research on the quality of educational standards, our knowledge about the quality of textbooks, and the performance of high-achieving students on international assessments all point to the need for exemplary curricula for gifted and talented young people. The gap between research in these areas and the needs of gifted and talented learners is startlingly clear. This article includes information about the development of a rubric that was originally designed to assess the quality of curricular units that are submitted annually to the National Association for Gifted Children (NAGC) Curriculum Division's Curriculum Competition. The article also includes information about 4 different, but related, uses for the rubric. Ultimately, we hope that the use of this tool and assessment technique by practitioners across the country will begin to close the enormous gap between the learning needs of gifted and talented young people and curricula.",489.0,Bridging the gap: A tool and technique to analyze and evaluate gifted education curricular units,2002.0

"Socioeconomic stratification and its influences on talent development: Some interdisciplinary perspectives   There is growing concern in our field about the plight of high-potential children who suffer from socioeconomic deprivation. Efforts to find and serve these children require in-depth understanding of socioeconomic contexts that shape and subvert talent development. In this analysis, socioeconomic barriers to talent development are explored from the vantage points of major thinkers and recent research findings in context-sensitive disciplines such as economics, sociology and ethical philosophy. Insights drawn from these perspectives provide the basis for recommendations that educators of the gifted clarify conceptions of merit and ability; look for hidden socioeconomic influences on aspirations, motivation, and talent development; and engage in critical activism for deprived high-potential children.",491.0,Socioeconomic stratification and its influences on talent development: Some interdisciplinary perspectives,2002.0
"Motivation is first-then they can do anything: Portrait of an Indian school for the gifted and talented   Utilizing a qualitative research methodology, the researcher presents a Portrait of the Jnana Prabhodini School in Pune, Maharashtra, India. Observations, interviews, and document review were conducted. The purpose of the school is to educate gifted and talented students not only for academics, but for motivation to help their state, country, and the world. The school is indigenous, based on the philosophy of Swami Vivekanada. The rhetoric of the field of the education of the gifted and talented is that bright students are our future leaders. This school in India seems geared to producing leaders than does current gifted education in the United States. The JP school seem to fall within the philosophies of Freire and Krishnamurti, who urged that education should lead to liberation of students' minds from the conditioning of society and then to the liberation of others.",492.0,Motivation is first-then they can do anything: Portrait of an Indian school for the gifted and talented,2002.0
"Understanding giftedness and underachievement: At the edge of possibility   Although many ways of doing research exist in education, much of the research conducted has focused on identifying or defining strategies to fit learners to existing theories of education and schooling. This article examines historical styles of research conducted around the construct of gifted underachievement. It then explores possibilities of implementing alternative approaches and theoretical arguments in practical applications in this area. Goals include providing an overview of research focused on gifted underachievement, examining research positions (paradigms) that more vividly represent complexity inherent in educating gifted individuals, and providing precepts that guide practitioners and scholars to alternative views of the research process and use of research outcomes.",493.0,Understanding giftedness and underachievement: At the edge of possibility,2002.0
"Constructions of high academic achievement through the analysis of critical events   In this study, critical events in the career development of Finnish Academy professors describe the trajectories of their achievement and success throughout the lifespan. Focused open-ended interviews, curricula vitae, and field notes produced representations of high achievement, which in this article relate to the system model of talent, to the concept of successful intelligence, and, more widely, to the poststructural understanding of knowledge construction. The purpose of the article is to describe the primary themes resulting from descriptive analysis. These themes included mentors, academic years abroad, strong interest in the domain, and luck. Also described are the transformative themes, which comprised situated construction of academic career and reflectiveness that lay beyond the constitution of descriptive themes. Interpretation moves from descriptive to transformative analysis and is supported with the stories of Gatekeeper, Professional Leader, and Disappointed Idealist. These scientists' stories illustrate the situatedness and individualistic nature of scientific achievement, connecting and reconnecting issues of time, place, and in various ways.",494.0,Constructions of high academic achievement through the analysis of critical events,2002.0
"In search of an elegant solution: Reanalysis of Plucker, Callahan, and Tomchin, with respects to Pyryt and Plucker   The purpose of this article is to illustrate the use of confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to explicate constructs underlying performance assessment tasks based on Gardner's (1983) theory of multiple intelligences. Data from Plucker, Callahan, and Tomchin (1996) were reanalysed using CFA. I analyzed several models based on the theoretical conceptualization of the authors, their exploratory factor analysis and the subsequent reanalysis of the data by Pyryt (2000). Models that allowed for intercorrelations among factors fit better than those without such correlations. Although the performance tasks appeared to measure their constructs as predicted, a model with three factors that combined Linguistic and Interpersonal Intelligence, rather than the four original factors, was supported. Higher order models indicated the presence of a general factor underlying the multiple intelligences. Although not conforming exactly to the original theory it appears that this set of performance tasks is a step in the right direction in terms of measuring multiple intelligences. Pyryt's concern for the influence of g was confirmed to some extent, but it appears that both factors and individual tasks retain sufficient variance to allow for the interpretation that they measure separate abilities.",495.0,"In search of an elegant solution: Reanalysis of Plucker, Callahan, and Tomchin, with respects to Pyryt and Plucker",2002.0

"Global and domain-specific self-concepts in academically talented Asian American and white adolescents   Previous research has suggested that ethnic groups may not only differ on self-concept, but that self-concept variables may be of different importance to different ethnic groups. This study examined these questions in a sample of academically talented White and Asian American students. White students obtained significantly higher scores than Asian Americans in scholastic and job self-concepts, but the effect sizes were small. No domain-specific was a strong predictor of global self-concept for Asian American students, whereas self-concept related to appearance was a strong predictor of global self-concept for White students.",498.0,Global and domain-specific self-concepts in academically talented Asian American and white adolescents,2002.0
"Multiple creativities? Investigating domain-specificity of creativity in young children   One of the most controversial issues in contemporary research on creativity-whether a person's creativity in domain-specific or domain-general was investigated with 109 second-grade children. The purposes of this study were to (1) provide empirical support for the domain-specific theory of creativity, (2) show relationships among children's creative performances as measured by three product-based assessments in three domains (storytelling, collage-making, and math word problems), and (3) explore the relationship between children's creative performances and their general creative thinking skills, as measured by the Wallach-Kogan Creative Thinking Test and the Real-World Divergent Thinking Test. The findings of this study support the position of domain-specificity of creativity. Children exhibited a range of creative abilities across different domains, rather than a uniform creative ability in diverse domains, indicating there is considerable intra-individual variation in creative ability by domain. Divergent thinking measures in this study did not predict creative performance in at least two of three, if not all, domains assessed in the study. Implications of the study in connection with educational practices for gifted children are discussed.",499.0,Multiple creativities?

"Using performance tasks in the identification of economically disadvantaged and minority gifted learners: Findings from project STAR   This paper discusses the rationale for developing performance assessment tasks to augment the identification of more economically disadvantaged and minority students for gifted programs in one state; provides a blue-print for the development protocol, including preteaching, rubrics, and exemplars; and shows major findings for use of the protocol with intended students. The performance assessment tasks were developed and revised based on try-out, pilot, and field test data collected across multiple districts with more than 4,000 students at primary and intermediate grades. Appropriate technical adequacy data. were used for decision making on rubric revisions. Criterion levels of performance within domains were developed to ensure inclusion of populations of interest without compromising the integrity of the task protocols. The performance assessment tasks of Project STAR resulted in finding an additional group of students who were 12% African American and 14% low-income children during the field test of the instrument. These students represent who would not have qualified for gifted programs using traditional-measures. In that sense, the assessment approach yields a value-added component to the state identification system. Thus, Project STAR provides an effective and innovative approach to finding more low-SES and minority gifted students for programs.",500.0,Using performance tasks in the identification of economically disadvantaged and minority gifted learners: Findings from project STAR,2002.0
"Socioemotional factors contributing to adjustment among early-entrance college students   This study investigates the influence of self-concept and perceived family environment on psychosocial adjustment among early-entrance college students. Participants included 104 male and 76 female juniors at the Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science (TAMS). Scholastic aptitude, previous academic achievement, and family environment were employed as latent independent variables. Self-content, personal adjustment to TAMS, and academic achievement at TAMS were the latent dependent variables of the study. A series of regression models was used to assess the predictive utility of independent measures. The final model indicated that a combination of self-concept and family environment variables was able to predict psychosocial adjustment. Specifically, family cohesion, conflict, and expressiveness and overall self-concept were predictive of adjustment to college as measured by the total score of the Student Adjustment to College Questionnaire. For TAMS students, family cohesion, organization, control, conflict, and overall self-concept were found to predict academic achievement as measured by first semester grade-point average. it is recommended that applicant self-concept should be considered when educating students about considering early entrance to college, making program decisions, and instituting retention strategies for early-entrance college programs.",501.0,Socioemotional factors contributing to adjustment among early-entrance college students,2002.0
"Decisions regarding music training: Parental beliefs and values   Musical talent development generally involves high levels of parental support over an extended period of time. This study examined parents' expectancy beliefs and values regarding their child's music training, regular academic work, and athletic activities. Parents of 231 students, aged 6-18, who attended programs at four music institutions responded to a questionnaire. The results suggest that parents may initially send their children for music training not for musical talent development per se, but for more general educational value. However, with more training and more advanced musical development, parents seem to regulate their beliefs and values across the store domains in the single-minded service of musical talent development.",502.0,Decisions regarding music training: Parental beliefs and values,2002.0
"Examining perceptions of challenge and choice in classrooms: The relationship between teachers and their students and comparisons between gifted students and other students   In this study we investigated the relationship between what teachers report they do in their classrooms and their students' perceptions of classroom activities with pea-to-the dimensions of challenge and choice. students and teachers in elementary school classrooms (n = 91 classrooms) were analyzed separately from those in middle schools classrooms (n = 64 classrooms). No relationship existed between what teachers reported they do and what students perceived is clone at the elementary or middle school levels concerning the dimension of challenge. Further, concerning choice, a light positive correlation existed for elementary students, and their teachers, whereas no such relationship is at the middle school level. These findings suggest that what teachers report may not be what students actually experience in the classroom. Additionally, differences among perceptions of challenge and choice of gifted students in magnet schools, gifted students in regular schools, and other students in regular schools were investigated. Regarding challenge, magnet school gifted students reported signficantly more challenge than their gifted and, other peers at the middle school level whereas no such differences existed at the elementary level. No meaningful difference existed among the groups on the dimension of choice at either the elementary or middle school levels.",503.0,Examining perceptions of challenge and choice in classrooms: The relationship between teachers and their students and comparisons between gifted students and other students,2002.0

"Looking through the glasses: J. D. Salinger's wise children and gifted education   Gifted children are often Big Picture thinkers (Schultz & Delisle, 1997). Even as young children, they may ask profound questions and view life from the perspective of The Most Important Things: meaning, goodness, truth, spirituality, death, and the like. J. D. Salinger's stories about the gifted and precocious children offer a vivid, provocative, and very useful description of a spiritual Big Picture perspective on life. This essay describes the Glasses' spiritual development and draws out implications of their thinking and dilemmas for a critique of gifted education. It suggests that gifted education can adequately address the spiritual life of gifted students and other Big Picture perspectives only by becoming concerned h educating gifted children for life.",507.0,Looking through the glasses: J.

"Gifts and talents as sources of envy in high school settings   This article explores a new empirical approach to explaining some social difficulties experienced by talented students: peer envy toward their gifts and talents. A sample of 689 French Canadian high school students completed two questionnaires addressing both the envy they felt and the envy expressed toward them. The results focus on two themes: (a) the relative intensity and frequency of envy towards gifts and talents as compared to other potential objects of envy, and (b) the influence of various students characteristics or school settings on the student's answers. The results showed a large discrepancy between the envious and envied perspectives. In the first perspective, students did manifest more envy toward their peer's social and financial successes than toward their academic achievements or intelligence. On the other hand, when invited to identify objects for which they were envied, academic talent became the most frequently reported.",508.0,Gifts and talents as sources of envy in high school settings,2002.0

"Changing general education classroom practices to adapt for gifted students   Ennded by the Jacob K. Javits Gifted and Talented Education Act, the Mustard Seed Project's major goal was to train teachers to differentiate curricula for gifted students in the general education classroom. This study addressed the changes in classroom practices and the factors that influenced these changes. Changes were measured using the Classroom Instructional Practices Scale (Johnsen, 1992). The sample included 1 urban and 5 rural sites, 8 principals, 74 teachers, 17 mentor teachers, and 18 community representatives. Throughout the two years of implementation, the majority of teachers at each site made changes. Changes in classroom practices and influencing factors were determined from interviews, field notes, formal and informal observations, and a final survey. Participants cited staff-development activities, leadership mentoring, resources, and project support as extremely beneficial.",510.0,Changing general education classroom practices to adapt for gifted students,2002.0
"Perceptions of a self-contained class for fourth- and fifth-grade students with high to extreme levels of intellectual giftedness   This qualitative case study was designed to investigate the effectiveness of a new self-contained classroom curriculum that was differentiated for highly intellectually gifted students. The special class was investigated throughout its first year of operation in a mid-west school district. Participating students were and fifth graders with IQ scores on the Slosson Intelligence Test Revised ranging from 148 to 193. Data were collected using observations, interviews, comparison essays, and a goal-attainment scale. Qualitative data were analyzed using the techniques of open, axial, and selective coding, data displays, and peer debriefing; quantitative data were analyzed with descriptive statistics. The results suggested that the self-contained classroom provided a challenging learning environment for highly intellectually gifted students, but that the responses of individual students to this more challenging environment varied considerably, creating different emotional and social outcomes for specific students at different times during the school year. The results suggest that gifted and talented programming can have differential effects on individual students and that future program evaluation research should attempt to investigate the etiology of these differential effects.",511.0,Perceptions of a self-contained class for fourth- and fifth-grade students with high to extreme levels of intellectual giftedness,2002.0
