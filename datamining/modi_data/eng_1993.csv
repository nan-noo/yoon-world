"SOCIAL, EMOTIONAL, AND BEHAVIORAL-ADJUSTMENT OF ACCELERATED STUDENTS, STUDENTS IN GIFTED CLASSES, AND REGULAR STUDENTS IN 8TH GRADE   This study investigated differences in the social, emotional, and behavioral adjustment of gifted and regular eighth-grade students. Three groups were identified: (a) gifted students who entered school early or skipped at least one grade K-7, (b) students enrolled in eighth-grade gifted classes, and (c) regular eighth-grade students. Data were self-reported in the National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS) from the National Center for Educational Statistics (NCES) (Ingels et al., 1989). Results indicated that accelerated students and students in gifted classes had better perceptions of their social relationships and emotional development and tended to have fewer serious school behavior problems than regular students. Contrary to commonly held beliefs, most students who entered school early or skipped elementary grades did not report unusual social isolation or experience profound emotional difficulties. They had serious behavioral problems less frequently than regular students.",789.0,"SOCIAL, EMOTIONAL, AND BEHAVIORAL-ADJUSTMENT OF ACCELERATED STUDENTS, STUDENTS IN GIFTED CLASSES, AND REGULAR STUDENTS IN 8TH GRADE",1993.0
"A COMPARISON OF GIFTED UNDERACHIEVERS AND GIFTED HIGH ACHIEVERS   The purpose of this study was to compare a national sample of gifted underachievers and gifted high achievers on a number of characteristics. Giftedness was measured as a composite score at or above the 95th percentile on the American College Testing Program (ACT). Underachievement was defined as reporting a high school grade-point average of less-than-or-equal-to 2.25 (on a 4.00 scale), and high achievement was defined as reporting a grade-point average of greater-than-or-equal-to 3.75 (on a 4.00 scale). Participants for this study were 30,604 high school juniors and seniors: gifted underachievers n=257: gifted high achievers n=30,347. The underachievers generally had lower scores on the ACT and less extensive out-of-class accomplishments. Over 90% of the underachievers were Caucasian males. Comparisons are provided on a number of nonacademic variables between underachievers and high achievers.",790.0,A COMPARISON OF GIFTED UNDERACHIEVERS AND GIFTED HIGH ACHIEVERS,1993.0
"EDUCATION PATTERNS OF ACADEMICALLY TALENTED YOUTH   Students who participated in The Johns Hopkins University Center for Talented Youth Academic Programs are compared to eligible students who did not enroll in CTY courses. The two groups of students. over a 5-year period (1980-1984), were matched on gender and Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores. The results of a questionnaire completed when the last group had finished high school suggest an education pattern of high academic achievement by both groups, with many students pursuing a rigorous high school program including College Board Advanced Placement courses and college courses outside of school. However, students who participated in CTY academic programs reported taking more advanced courses at an earlier age and enrolling in more college courses while in high school than students who did not attend CTY courses. The education pattern and accompanying achievements. exemplified by both groups. provide a validation for the selection instrument. the SAT.",791.0,EDUCATION PATTERNS OF ACADEMICALLY TALENTED YOUTH,1993.0
"SUMMER RESIDENTIAL PROGRAMS - ACADEMICS AND BEYOND   Every summer, bright students participate in highly challenging residential programs on university campuses. Since many students return year after year, they must be finding something of great value. Although we have confirmation of their academic achievement, little has been done to ascertain the students' own perceptions of the total program experience. This study employed the qualitative research tool of interview and the principles of phenomenology to discern how a group of students saw and interpreted the value of the summer programs. Twelve students who attended Purdue University's residential programs for at least 3 years were interviewed to discover what stood out in their minds as important events during the programs: how they interpreted the effect of the programs on their academic. social, and emotional lives: and what brought them back year after year. A telephone interview was also conducted with a parent of each student to collect their perceptions of the value of the programs for their children. The interviews revealed the importance of summer program experiences for these students. The satisfaction of challenging course work taught by caring. expert teachers and the opportunity to live on a university campus were significant to them: making friends and gaining confidence in their own abilities were equally vital.",792.0,SUMMER RESIDENTIAL PROGRAMS - ACADEMICS AND BEYOND,1993.0
"THE EFFECTS OF THE ELIMINATION OF GIFTED AND TALENTED PROGRAMS ON PARTICIPATING STUDENTS AND THEIR PARENTS   Interviews were conducted with 19 parents of students identified and served by a gifted program eliminated in 1990 to determine the effects of the elimination of the program on participants. To triangulate the findings of the interviews, mail surveys were sent to 49 additional parents of students who were also served and identified by the program. Results indicated that parents perceived that their children were experiencing a decline in energy. curiosity, and intrinsic motivation to achieve at high levels and were beginning to disengage from the traditional curriculum. Interviewed parents also reported that the process of program elimination resulted in so much divisiveness that more than half of them had considered alternative educational avenues for their children's remaining years in school.",793.0,THE EFFECTS OF THE ELIMINATION OF GIFTED AND TALENTED PROGRAMS ON PARTICIPATING STUDENTS AND THEIR PARENTS,1993.0
"CHILD PRODIGIES - A DISTINCTIVE FORM OF GIFTEDNESS   The basic premise of this article is that the child prodigy is a distinct form of giftedness which must be understood on its own terms. In contrast with the child of great general ability, the prodigy tends to have a more focused, specialized. and domain-specific form of giftedness. Studies of prodigies have contributed to changing theories about the nature of giftedness (e.g., from single to multiple) and will likely continue to do so. Along with the related phenomenon of savant syndrome. the prodigy points to a set of complex relationships between psychometric intelligence in the traditional sense and expression of talent within specific domains like music or mathematics. Based in part on findings from studies of prodigies. it is likely that there are important roles for both general and specific abilities in most forms of giftedness and that they represent two distinct evolutionary trends to maximize the likelihood of human survival.",794.0,CHILD PRODIGIES - A DISTINCTIVE FORM OF GIFTEDNESS,1993.0

"METACOGNITION AND GIFTEDNESS - THE STATE OF THE RELATIONSHIP   This paper offers a critical examination of the relationship between metacognition and giftedness. First, the role of metacognition in giftedness is explored in the context of current conceptions of giftedness proposed by different theorists. Second, in an attempt to search for empirical evidence linking metacognition to giftedness, various studies of giftedness are reviewed. It is concluded that theoretical and research support is offered for the important role of metacognition in understanding and explaining giftedness. Finally, rather than arguing that the relationship between metacognition and giftedness is clear-cut and conclusive, unresolved issues are discussed and suggestions for future investigations are made.",797.0,METACOGNITION AND GIFTEDNESS - THE STATE OF THE RELATIONSHIP,1993.0
"CREATIVITY AND INTELLIGENCE IN PRESCHOOLERS   This study examined the relationship between creativity and intelligence in preschoolers. Four hundred and ninety-six children for whom parents were seeking admission to a program for bright or gifted preschoolers in a midwestern city participated. All children were given the Thinking Creatively in Action and Movement Scale; 72 children were given the Slosson Intelligence Test, 354 were given the L-M edition of the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale, and the remaining 70 children were given the Stanford-Binet Fourth Edition. Results indicated that creativity was significantly related to intelligence when IQs were less than 120 but was not related at higher levels. However, the practical significance of the significant relationships was small. The implications of the findings for the development of programs for gifted or talented preschoolers are discussed.",798.0,CREATIVITY AND INTELLIGENCE IN PRESCHOOLERS,1993.0
"IDENTIFYING MATHEMATICALLY TALENTED ELEMENTARY STUDENTS - USING THE LOWER LEVEL OF THE SSAT   In this paper we report on the usefulness of an identification instrument for mathematically talented students in third through fifth grades. Talented students from Iowa and Texas took the Quantitative, Reading Comprehension, and Verbal sections of the Lower Level of the Secondary School Admission Test (SSAT-L), which was developed by the Educational Testing Service for fifth through seventh graders. Students' scores covered nearly the entire possible range of the test, indicating that the SSAT-L effectively differentiated among talented elementary students.",799.0,IDENTIFYING MATHEMATICALLY TALENTED ELEMENTARY STUDENTS - USING THE LOWER LEVEL OF THE SSAT,1993.0
"PROGRAMS FOR MATHEMATICALLY GIFTED STUDENTS - A REVIEW OF EMPIRICAL-RESEARCH   This paper summarizes and critiques the empirical research of the 1970s and 1980s on programs for mathematically gifted students. Much research has shown that accelerating the mathematics curriculum provides a very good program for precocious students. Organizational plans that place mathematically gifted students together for mathematics instructions also offer opportunities for these students to perform well. Although technology-based instruction also appears to provide an efficacious way of providing instruction for mathematically gifted elementary students, this method should be examined further with older students and in long-term studies. Research with enriched curricula and non-computer-based instruction provided inconclusive evidence of efficacy for mathematically gifted students.",800.0,PROGRAMS FOR MATHEMATICALLY GIFTED STUDENTS - A REVIEW OF EMPIRICAL-RESEARCH,1993.0
"THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SCALE FOR THE EVALUATION OF GIFTED IDENTIFICATION INSTRUMENTS (SEGII)   The selection of instruments to screen and identify gifted and talented students is a difficult and problematic task faced by school divisions. The evaluation of instruments should include consideration of the reliability and the validity of instruments according to the specific purpose for which they are being used, the population on which they will be used, and the other characteristics considered vital for fair test use. This article presents a scale designed specifically for that purpose for use by school decision-makers.",801.0,THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SCALE FOR THE EVALUATION OF GIFTED IDENTIFICATION INSTRUMENTS (SEGII),1993.0

"THE RELATION OF GENDER AND ACADEMIC-ACHIEVEMENT TO CAREER SELF-EFFICACY AND INTERESTS   Career self-efficacy has been identified as an important variable in career choice and development. In this study, gender and academic achievement were studied in relation to career self-efficacy for female, male, and sex-balanced occupations. Girls had higher efficacy expectations for some female careers and lower efficacy expectations for some male careers than boys. Girls and boys did not differ in their efficacy expectations for sex-balanced occupations. The overall influence of gender on career self-efficacy was quite modest. Achievement was found to be a more powerful predictor of career self-efficacy than gender. These findings are discussed in relation to the need to enable talented young women to realize their abilities through career achievement.",805.0,THE RELATION OF GENDER AND ACADEMIC-ACHIEVEMENT TO CAREER SELF-EFFICACY AND INTERESTS,1993.0
"LEISURE ACTIVITIES IN CAREER GUIDANCE FOR GIFTED AND TALENTED ADOLESCENTS - A VALIDATION-STUDY OF THE TEL-AVIV ACTIVITIES INVENTORY   Leisure activities may predict adult accomplishment better than conventional predictors such as intelligence or school grades because their performance requires not only intellectual abilities, but also task commitment, persistence, and other cognitive and personal-social attributes that determine life outcomes. Research on the leisure activities of young gifted children has been sparse in part because of the lack of psychometric instruments designed for use with children. The validity of the Tel-Aviv Activities Inventory, a measure of leisure activities specifically designed for children and adolescents was investigated in 934 junior/senior high school students. The 62 activities inventory items were entered for factor analysis. The 10-factor maximum likelihood solution with varimax rotation was selected, resulting in extracting factors most similar to the hypothesized factor structure. The results indicated that the instrument may be useful for career counseling with gifted and talented children. Recommendations for the revision of the current edition of the instrument are suggested.",806.0,LEISURE ACTIVITIES IN CAREER GUIDANCE FOR GIFTED AND TALENTED ADOLESCENTS - A VALIDATION-STUDY OF THE TEL-AVIV ACTIVITIES INVENTORY,1993.0
"SEX-DIFFERENCES IN THE APTITUDES AND TALENTS OF CHILDREN AS JUDGED BY PEERS AND TEACHERS   Over 40 different descriptions of aptitudes and talents were distributed among nine experimental peer nomination forms (PNF). These PNFs were administered to two large samples of elementary and junior high school Pupils and to their teachers. Sex ratios were computed for each ability among those pupils who emerged as the 10% to 15% ablest in their group as independently judged by their peers and teachers. No less than 60% of the 42 items had a significant overrepresentation of girls (or boys); these ratios exceeded 2:1 in a majority of cases. Boys were judged to be more talented in physical aptitudes and technical talents, and girls were judged to be more talented in arts (especially music) and socioaffective aptitudes. Intercorrelations between data from six different samples showed a very high reproducibility of these sex ratios, regardless of whether the judges were peers or tear-hers or whether samples came from elementary or junior high schools. Various arguments are presented to demonstrate that these judgments by peers and teachers accurately represent the differential abilities manifested by boys and girls in the school environment.",807.0,SEX-DIFFERENCES IN THE APTITUDES AND TALENTS OF CHILDREN AS JUDGED BY PEERS AND TEACHERS,1993.0
"EARLY DEVELOPMENT OF LANGUAGE AND LITERACY SKILLS OF AN EXTREMELY PRECOCIOUS READER   Precocious literacy is a form of intellectual giftedness that occurs frequently in young children. This case study documents the emergence of reading ability in an extremely precocious reader between the ages of 2 years 7 months and 3 years 2 months. At the end of this period, the child's word recognition ability was conservatively estimated at the late first-grade level, and he was able to use knowledge of some level of letter-sound correspondences to sound out unfamiliar words and pseudowords. However, his writing skills did not begin to develop to a comparable degree until after he was 4 years old. The results are used to generate hypotheses about the nature and measurement of precocious reading and its relations with oral language and writing skills.",808.0,EARLY DEVELOPMENT OF LANGUAGE AND LITERACY SKILLS OF AN EXTREMELY PRECOCIOUS READER,1993.0
"WISC-R PROFILES OF CHILDREN WITH SUPERIOR INTELLECTUAL ABILITY   The WISC-R profiles of 456 Grade 3 students with full scale IQs of 120 and above were analyzed. Large subtest scatter, verbal-performance discrepancy, and idiographic variability appear to be normal for the test profiles of bright students. They excelled in complex reasoning but were often not different from average students in their attention span, memory, sequential reasoning, visual-spatial perception, or visual-motor coordination. Differences were identified in subgroups according to verbal or nonverbal strengths and gender. Boys showed strengths for simultaneous and visual-spatial reasoning, and girls showed strengths for sequential and social reasoning. Academic achievement varied as a function of full scale IQ and verbal or nonverbal strengths. Implications for educational programming are discussed.",809.0,WISC-R PROFILES OF CHILDREN WITH SUPERIOR INTELLECTUAL ABILITY,1993.0
"GIFTED EDUCATION - WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY   Educators and parents of gifted students have many concerns as current movements of educational restructuring and reform sweep the country. However, unparalleled opportunities emerge from the swelling interest in education that focuses on the individual learning needs of all students. This interest should be perceived as a window of opportunity. In order to take advantage of the opportunities, gifted program personnel will want to keep an open mind toward concepts such as inclusion and collaboration. Without giving up the cause as champions of differentiated learning opportunities for highly able students, they can be accepted at last as key conversants in the educational dialogue. Then they can work in more integrative and productive ways with general classroom teachers, administrators, parents, and community leaders to develop exceptional student potential.",810.0,GIFTED EDUCATION - WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY,1993.0

"CREATIVE GIFTEDNESS - A MULTIVARIATE INVESTMENT APPROACH   This article presents an ''investment'' view of creative giftedness. Creatively gifted individuals ''buy low and sell high.'' In other words, they propose ideas that initially seem odd, out of sync with the ideas of others. Over time, however, these gifted individuals bring these ideas to fruition, convince other people of the worth of their ideas. and then metaphorically sell the ideas when these ideas are at a ''high price.'' They then move on to the next novel idea. In order to buy low and sell high, one needs a combination of six resources that function interactively: intelligence, knowledge, styles of thinking, personality, motivation, and environment. Each of these resources and its role in creative giftedness is described. The interaction of resources, domain specificity of giftedness, and identification of creatively gifted individuals are also discussed.",812.0,CREATIVE GIFTEDNESS - A MULTIVARIATE INVESTMENT APPROACH,1993.0
"DIVERGENT THINKING, CREATIVITY, AND GIFTEDNESS   Creativity is an important facet of giftedness. Creativity is, however, very difficult to define and measure. Divergent thinking tests are often used, though of course they really just estimate the potential for creative thought. In the past few years, the technologies for the assessment and enhancement of divergent thinking have changed dramatically. This article reviews the most recent research on divergent thinking. Several new assessment techniques are reviewed, including those using either lenient or stringent solution standards, those relying on ideational pools (examinees' total output of ideas), and those involving qualitative aspects of ideation. Recent research showing moderately high predictive validity coefficients is also reviewed. The role played by evaluation and valuation in the divergent thinking process is outlined, as is the role of problem definition and problem identification. Special considerations for the creativity of gifted children are noted throughout the article, and specific directions for future research on the divergent thinking of gifted children are presented in the conclusion.",813.0,"DIVERGENT THINKING, CREATIVITY, AND GIFTEDNESS",1993.0

"EFFECTS OF A CREATIVE PROBLEM-SOLVING CURRICULUM ON STUDENTS OF VARYING ABILITY LEVELS   This study investigated the effects of a creative problem solving curriculum on students of varying ability. Subjects were 267 middle school students in six schools who had previously been designated as gifted, honors, or average. To assess problem solving, treatment and comparison students responded to a hypothetical problem before and after the treatment, with results scored by two independent judges for problem fluency, solution fluency, flexibility, originality, and use of criteria. Teachers rated the creativity, ability to work in groups, and potential giftedness of all students before and after the treatment. Treatment students showed significant gains in problem-solving ability compared with comparisons, with no significant differences among ability levels. Teacher ratings for gifted comparison students increased compared to those for gifted treatment students; ratings for treatment honors students generally increased. Teacher ratings for average students did not change, despite significant increases in their problem-solving ability.",815.0,EFFECTS OF A CREATIVE PROBLEM-SOLVING CURRICULUM ON STUDENTS OF VARYING ABILITY LEVELS,1993.0
"HOW WELL DO PEERS AGREE AMONG THEMSELVES WHEN NOMINATING THE GIFTED OR TALENTED   To validate a set of peer nomination forms, 40 different prototypical descriptions were written to represent four aptitude domains (intellectual, creative, socio-affective, physical) and four talent fields (academic, technical, artistic, interpersonal). They were distributed among six experimental forms, which were paired and administered in counterbalanced order at a 3-week interval to a sample of 2350 pupils about equally divided between both sexes and three grades (4, 5, 6), and to the teachers of their 88 groups. Indices of reliability - interpeer agreement - were computed for each prototype in every group. A majority of the prototypes maintained acceptable interpeer agreement levels; important variations were observed associated with a small age effect, a significant group effect, and a very large prototype effect, confirming that interpeer agreement depends first and foremost on the specific aptitude or talent assessed. Consensus among peers was best for intellectual and physical aptitudes, and academic and artistic talents; it was worst for socio-affective aptitudes and interpersonal talents.",816.0,HOW WELL DO PEERS AGREE AMONG THEMSELVES WHEN NOMINATING THE GIFTED OR TALENTED,1993.0
