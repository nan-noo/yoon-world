"Attributional choices for academic success and failure by intellectually gifted students   This study emerges from the lack of empirical research on the gifted students' attributions about acedemic success and failure in multiple subject areas and school in general. We explore differences in top attributional choices between boys and girls for success and failure in general acedemic, language arts, science, and mathematics. Gifted students were more likely to attribute failure to not working hard enough (long-term effort), rather than to not being smart (ability). Sex differences were found in attributional choices for genmeral academics, science, mathematics, and language arts. The findings counter some popular theoretica expectations of gifted students' attributional choicescfor success and failure in their acdemic performance.",360.0,Attributional choices for academic success and failure by intellectually gifted students,2006.0
"Suicide ideation and personality characteristics among gifted adolescents   This study describes psychological characteristics of gifted adolescents. It also identifies the relationships between psychological personality types and suicide ideation. Participation in the study were 152 juniors enrolled in a public residential high school for academically gifted students. The Suicides Ideation Questionnaire, a 30-item self-report measure, was use to assess adolescent levels of suicide ideation. The Myers-Type Indicator (MBTI; Myers, 1962), a widely used measure of psychological type that contrasts four dimensions of personality - extraversion (E)/introversion (I), sensing (S)/intuition (N), thinking (T)/feeling (F), and judging (J)/perceiving (P) - was used to determine personality types of the students. The results indicated that gifted adolescents did not exhibit heightened rates of suicide ideation compared to their nongifted peers. However, female students held higher levels of suicide ideation than male students. Female students exhibiting introversion-perceiving (IP) types held higher levels of suicide ideation than those with other types. There was a significant between-groups effect for judging-perceiving analysis. Students identified as perceiving personality types held higher levels of suicide ideation than those with the judging personality type. Gender, judging/perceiving, and extraversion/introversion combined to reliably predict approximately 18% of the variance in suicide ideation in this sample.",361.0,Suicide ideation and personality characteristics among gifted adolescents,2006.0
"Insights from SMPY's greatest former child prodigies: Drs. Terence (Terry) Tao and Lenhard (Lenny) Ng reflect on their talent development   If the academic needs of the most profoundly gifted students can be met through the use of existing education practices, specialists in gifted education can assume that the educational needs of less able, but still academically talented, students can also be met by using some combination of these strategies as well. This paper illustrates the feasability and effectiveness of utilizing an individualized educational approach with gifted students by highlighting the unique educational paths taken by two of the very ablest math prodigies identified by Dr. Julian Stanley through the Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth (SMPY) since its founding in 1971. Interviews with Dr. Terence (Terry) Tao and Dr. Lenhard (Lenny) Ng, now both highly successful mathematicians, are presented in their entirety, demonstrating that even among the very ablest, strategies can be tailored effectively to the characterisitics of each student can be tailored effectively to the characteristics of each student through a combination of creative planning and the cooperation of parents, educators, and mentors.",362.0,Insights from SMPY's greatest former child prodigies: Drs.

"Perceived multiple intelligences among male and female Chinese gifted students in Hong Kong: The structure of the student multiple intelligences profile   This study examined the structure of perceived multiple intelligences of 1.464 Chinese gifted students using the Student Multiple Intelligence Profile. To evaluate whether perceived multiple intelligences could be applied adequately across boys and girls, a model hypothesizing different degrees of equivalence across the two gender groups was tested using multigroup confirmatory factor analysis. The results indicated that the structure of perceived multiple intelligences, which included the number and nature of dimensions, as well as the structural relationships among the 8 intelligences assessed, was largely similar for boys and girls. Subsequent second-order confirmatory factor analyses separately conducted for boys and girls suggested that both boys and girls might perceive the 8 intelligences or one of the nonpersonal intelligences. Implications of the findings including subtle differences in the perceived strengths on the 8 individual subtle differences in the perceived strengths on the 8 individual intelligences by boys and girls are discussed.",363.0,Perceived multiple intelligences among male and female Chinese gifted students in Hong Kong: The structure of the student multiple intelligences profile,2006.0

"A content analysis of evaluation findings across 20 gifted programs: A clarion call for enhanced gifted program development   This article delineates the results of 7 gifted program evaluation studies conducted in 20 different school districts and places them in the context of major areas for gifted program improvement. The author suggests that the field of gifted education may be vulnerable to losing its infrastructure at local levels if enhanced program development in key areas does not occur over the next few years and if the studied districts are at all similar to the larger group. The paper discusses key areas of program development including identification, curriculum, program design, staff development, parental involvement assessment, and evaluation. The author contends that attention to these areas is essential for improving gifted program quality and stabilizing programs.",370.0,A content analysis of evaluation findings across 20 gifted programs: A clarion call for enhanced gifted program development,2006.0
"A study of instructional methods used in fast-paced classes   This study involved 15 secondary-level teachers who taught fast-paced classes at a university-based program and similar regularly paced their local schools in order to examine classes in how teachers differentiate or modify instructional methods and content selections for fast-paced classes. Interviews were conducted with the teachers during the summer sessions with a brief survey used as supplemental data. Overall, teachers in this study used a varied set of instructional strategies and in-class activities for their fast-paced classes including lectures, presentations, group activities, demonstrations, frequent tests and quizzes, timed writing, essays, and discussion. The shorter time frame (3 weeks versus 9 months) and teachers' perceptions about students' academic abilities were the two major reasons given for the differentiated instructional strategies and content in the fast-paced classes. In the survey data, less repetition in course content, advanced-level readings and questions, and more independence in learning were found for the fast-paced classes. Yet, the teachers were not likely to move beyond the textbook for enrichment materials or individualize homework or assignments for students in their fast-paced classes. They also expressed concerns regarding depth versus breadth of the material covered in the 3-week courses.",371.0,A study of instructional methods used in fast-paced classes,2006.0
"Perfectionism in high-ability students: Relational precursors and influences on achievement motivation   The purpose of the present study was to create and test a model that (a) illustrated variables influencing the development of perfectionism, and (b) demonstrated how different types of perfectionism may influence the achievement goals of high-ability students. Using, a multiple-groups path analysis, the researchers found that parenting style was related to attachment, with authoritative and permissive parenting associated with secure attachment and authoritarian and uninvolved parenting associated with insecure attachment. Attachment, in turn, was related to perfectionism, with insecure attachment associated with either self-oriented or socially prescribed perfectionism. In addition, the model then illustrated that perfectionism would influence achievement goals, with self-oriented perfectionists more likely to set mastery or performance-approach goals, and socially prescribed perfectionists more likely to set performance-approach or performance-avoidance goals. The findings of this study are interpreted in the context of the existing literature, and implications for working with high-ability perfectionistic students are discussed.",372.0,Perfectionism in high-ability students: Relational precursors and influences on achievement motivation,2006.0
"Bullying among the gifted: The subjective experience   One portion of a national study of bullying, which surveyed gifted 8th graders regarding bullying during their school years (N = 432), used structured interviews (N = 57) to explore the lived experience of being bullied or being a bully. Qualitative analysis of interview data found that even just one incident was highly distressing for some. Also important are the findings that many victims suffered in silence, struggled to understand bullying, assumed responsibility for stopping it themselves, despaired when it continues, and thought violent thoughts. Intelligence appeared to have helped most of those interviewed of bullying, including those who had intentionally halted their own bullying. Many subjects believed that not being known contributed to being bullied. Helping students to make social connections and adjustments, especially during the early middle school years, may be crucial to their wellbeing and to their feeling safe in school.",373.0,Bullying among the gifted: The subjective experience,2006.0

"Instructional practices of teachers in general education classrooms and gifted resource rooms: Development and validation of the instructional practice questionnaire   An instrument to measure teachers' instructional practices, the Instructional Practice Questionnaire, was developed and validated in three phases. The questionnaires focused on three domains of instructional practices: cognitive, interpersonal, and intrapersonal. First, an initial questionnaire was developed for a pilot study, and data were gathered to analyze questionnaire items with 97 general education teachers. Second, the questionnaire was revised based on the findings of the first-phase data analysis. Third, the revised questionnaire was distributed to two new samples (144 general education teachers I and 67 GATE resource room teachers) in ail effort to provide reliability and validity evidence of the scores from the revised questionnaire. The questionnaire would be useful for educators and researchers who are interested in understanding instructional prac- tices of classroom teachers and in improving classroom instruction for gifted and talented students.",376.0,Instructional practices of teachers in general education classrooms and gifted resource rooms: Development and validation of the instructional practice questionnaire,2006.0
"The relationship between classroom environment and the learning style preferences of gifted middle school students and the impact on levels of performance   Inconsistent performance by gifted students has been a source of frustration for both parents and educators for decades. Several studies on gifted underachievement point to a connection between student learning styles and classroom performance. This study examined the learning styles of gifted middle school students, student perceptions of the classroom environment, and possible connections between learning style, classroom environment, and achievement levels. Eighty gifted students from grades 6, 7, and 8 were administered the Learning Style Inventory (LSI) to identify student learning style preferences. They were also adiministered the Student Perception Inventory (SPI), developed for the study, in order to determine perceptions of these learning style elements in their classroom environments. Results indicated that the LSI elements of persistence and lighting correlated with achievement In all content areas. Additionally, correlations between higher grade point averages (GPA) and LSI preferences for responsibility and teacher motivation were found in science and math classes. Results of the SPI revealed a correlation between higher grade point averages in social studies and science classrooms and the following items: persistence; motivation; and auditory, tactile, and kinesthetic modalities. All subject areas showed a correlation between higher GPA and the students' perceived level of persistence.",377.0,The relationship between classroom environment and the learning style preferences of gifted middle school students and the impact on levels of performance,2006.0
"A case study of teachers of gifted learners: Moving from prescribed practice to described practitioners   Two exemplary teachers of gifted learners were studied in order to get a better understanding of both teacher practices and teacher thoughts about those practices. Through extensive observation and in-depth interviews, these teachers demonstrated and discussed the qualities they felt to be essential for educating gifted learners. Though each teacher leads a different kind of classroom experience, both assert that (a) teaching gifted learners requires the framing of individualized and whole-group learning simultaneously, and (b) that the path a person takes to become a teacher of gifted learners is important. Equally significant is the way each of these teachers assimilates and combines some of the canonical ideas of gifted education. This kind of study is rare in our literature, but may be invaluable for teachers-pre-service teachers or those already working-who want to hone their skills in working with gifted learners.",378.0,A case study of teachers of gifted learners: Moving from prescribed practice to described practitioners,2006.0
"Five readers browsing: The reading interests of talented middle school boys   Researchers concerned with curriculum differentiation for gifted and talented students have long promoted the benefits of providing opportunities for students to explore their personal interests within the regular curriculum. Many literacy researchers have also concluded that teachers can improve students' (especially boys') attitudes toward reading by offering opportunities within the literacy curriculum for students to choose reading materials based on their own personal interests. However, there are few empirical investigations into the particular interests of talented boy readers to guide teachers who wish to provide students with a rich selection of texts from which to choose. In this multicase study, 5 boys who are talented readers were observed while they browsed for reading materials in a large bookstore. Interviews with each boy and analysis of the texts that they identified as personally interesting revealed 4 major themes that together characterize the complexity of these boys' reading preferences.",379.0,Five readers browsing: The reading interests of talented middle school boys,2006.0
"Bullying and the gifted: Victims, perpetrators, prevalence, and effects   Gifted eighth graders (N = 432) in 11 U.S. states participated in a retrospective national study that explored the prevalence and effects of being bullied and being a bully during kindergarten through grade 8. No significant differences were found related to size of city, race/ethnicity, and geographical region in terms of either being bullied or being a bully. Sixty-seven percent of all participants had experienced at least 1 of 13 kinds of bullying listed on the survey, more in grade 6 than in other grades, and 11 % had experienced repeated bullying. Name-calling and teasing about appearance were the most common kinds of bullying, and the latter was among several kinds of bullying significantly related to emotional impact. In grade 8, 16% were bullies, and 29% had violent thoughts. At all grade levels, a larger percentage of males than females were bullied, were bullied more than 10 times, and were bullies.",380.0,"Bullying and the gifted: Victims, perpetrators, prevalence, and effects",2006.0
"A study of well-being and school satisfaction among academically talented students attending a science high school in Korea   The purpose of this study was to examine whether academically talented adolescents attending a residential science high school in Korea had different levels of psychological well-being or school life satisfaction than their high-ability peers in regular high schools. The participating high-ability students (n = 299) were in their second year of high school and were attending either a science high school (n = 111) or a regular high school (n = 188) in the same province in Korea. Both groups completed the Psychological Well Being scales (Ryff, 1989a) and a researcher-constructed Satisfaction With School Life scale. In addition, the science high school students responded to open-ended questions about their experiences in the science high school. No statistically significant differences were found in psychological well-being, but there were statistically significant differences in school life satisfaction favoring the science high school group. The responses of the science high school sample to the open-ended questions indicated that they appreciated the advanced curriculum and the expertise of their teachers. They also reported satisfactory relationships with teachers and peers. Overall, the study suggested that the residential science high school was meeting the educational needs of these talented. Korean, students, at least better than traditional high. schools. However, this study could not confirm. its primary expectation that the specialized schooling for gifted students would enhance psychological well-being. Implications of the study for research and practice are discussed.",381.0,A study of well-being and school satisfaction among academically talented students attending a science high school in Korea,2006.0

It was hypothesized that this population of very intelligent children would demonstrate much larger Verbal-Performance discrepancies than are reported in the WISC-III manual. The hypothesis was confirmed, and a table reporting Verbal-Performance discrepancies established that very large discrepancies are typical for this population. The implications of these results are discussed, as well as the limitations of the study, particularly as it pertains to the limitations of the sample.",384.0,WISC-III verbal/performance discrepancies among a sample of gifted children,2006.0
"Breaking through assumptions about low-income, minority gifted students   This article describes Project Breakthrough, federally funded as a demonstration through the Javits Gifted and Talented Education Act. Project staff worked for 3 years with three elementary schools in South Carolina to train teachers in the use of language arts and science curriculum developed by the Center for Gifted Education at the College of William and Mary. Teachers implemented the William and Mary units and several of the teaching models used in the units with all students. Goals included (a) improved performance of low-, average-, and high-achieving students in mathematics, science, and language arts; and (b) identification of more low-income gifted students. The article reports on the nature of the project, its implementation, and the results that point to changes in teachers' perceptions of students' abilities and of improved student achievement.",385.0,"Breaking through assumptions about low-income, minority gifted students",2006.0
"Gifted university males in a Greek fraternity: Creating a culture of achievement   The gifted education community has called for more research examining gifted students during their collegiate experience. The study described in this article examined gifted university males involved in a Greek fraternity. Through a qualitative case study research design, the investigation examined the collegiate careers of 5 gifted, high-achieving university males to understand how their fraternity experience influenced their achievement. Major findings uncovered in chronicling the university careers of the 5 gifted males included the following: focusing on athletics rather than academics during high school, recruitment to the fraternity as high potential contributors, the fraternity as a bridge to student leadership on campus, and the benefits of a culture of well-rounded achievers striving for self-improvement. Implications of the findings are presented, as are suggestions for meeting the educational needs of gifted males in university settings.",386.0,Gifted university males in a Greek fraternity: Creating a culture of achievement,2006.0

"Counseling needs of gifted students: An analysis of intake forms at a university-based counseling center   The purpose of this study was to investigate perceptions of the counseling needs of gifted children from the perspective of parents who sought help from a fee-based counseling center for gifted students. The counseling center provided assessment and educational and career guidance, as well as family social/emotional counseling, all of which were differentiated to meet the needs of gifted children ages 4-18. Participating parents completed intake forms that included a 47-item client problem inventory and were designed to assist the counseling process. One hundred and twenty of these problem inventories were analyzed to determine which counseling needs led parents to bring their children for counseling services and whether there were any differences in perceived needs among three different developmental levels of children (preschool, preadolescent, and adolescent). Results suggested that age had a statistically and practically significant effect on parent perceptions of career and child (psychosocial) concerns and a practically significant effect on school, family, and peer concerns. For all age groups, parents perceived their child's greatest counseling need to be educational planning, followed closely by school concerns. Psychosocial concerns were also salient for parents of children older than 6. Career planning was important for parents of children older than 12. Peer and family concerns were less salient than the other categories of concern. The study suggests that gifted children do have unique needs for differentiated counseling services and that counseling services for gifted children should emphasize educational planning and be targeted to the needs of specific developmental levels.",388.0,Counseling needs of gifted students: An analysis of intake forms at a university-based counseling center,2006.0
"A microgenetic analysis of strategic variability in gifted and average-ability children   Many researchers have described cognitive differences between gifted and average-performing children. Regarding strategy use, the gifted advantage is often associated with differences such as greater knowledge of strategies, quicker problem solving, and the ability to use strategies more appropriately. The current study used microgenetic methods from developmental psychology to investigate strategic thinking in gifted children from the perspective of one of the newer models of strategic development, Siegler's (1996) adaptive strategy-choice model. Fifty 2nd-grade children, approximately half of which were identified as intellectually gifted and half of which were average-performing students, were videotaped while playing a computer strategy game. Gifted and average-ability children differed greatly in their patterns of strategy development and use. The implications of these findings on theory and practice are considered.",389.0,A microgenetic analysis of strategic variability in gifted and average-ability children,2006.0
