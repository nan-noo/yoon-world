"A longitudinal study of academic intrinsic motivation in intellectually gifted children: Childhood through early adolescence   Academic intrinsic motivation of intellectually gifted children and a comparison group was examined in the Fullerton Longitudinal Study. Children at ages 9 through 13 years were administered the Children's Academic Intrinsic Motivation Inventory which assesses intrinsic motivation for school learning in reading, math, social studies, science, and for school in general. Analyses showed that across the ages, relative to a peer comparison, gifted children had significantly higher academic intrinsic motivation across all subject areas and school in general. It is suggested that: Children who become intellectually gifted enjoy the process of learning to a greater extent; intrinsic motivation is important for potentiation of giftedness; Assessment of academic intrinsic motivation be included in selection of children for gifted programs.",671.0,A longitudinal study of academic intrinsic motivation in intellectually gifted children: Childhood through early adolescence,1996.0
"Motivational orientations and metacognitive abilities of intellectually gifted students   The study compared the motivational orientations (beliefs about the causes far school successes and failures and self-perceptions of competence) and metacognitive abilities (knowledge and reported use of learning and reading strategies) of 143 Grade 7 intellectually gifted students from a selective high school in Australia with 133 average-achieving age peers from comprehensive schools. Results revealed a general pattern of the gifted sample perceiving themselves to be cognitively more competent, thus less likely to attribute failures to lack of ability. In comparison with average-achieving peers, gifted students had greater confidence in their own personal control over successes or failures in school tasks (control over the amount of effort to put in and in the use of strategies), demonstrated more knowledge of learning strategies, and achieved higher levels of reading competence. The findings also revealed different patterns of relations:hips among motivation, metacognition, and academic competence for gifted students and the general cohort.",672.0,Motivational orientations and metacognitive abilities of intellectually gifted students,1996.0
"The incidence of perfectionism in gifted students   Using the Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale (Frost et al., 1990) perfectionism scores were compared between a group of 600 students identified as academically talented and a group of 418 peers from the general cohort. In this nationally gathered sample, all students were sixth graders and of similar socioeconomic status. Findings indicated little difference between the mean scores of the two groups. Comparisons were also made between the gifted students and the general cohort using an empirical typology of perfectionism. This analysis did not indicate a statistically significant difference in the frequency of perfectionistic types between gifted students and the general cohort. These findings suggest that the frequent anecdotal reports of greater perfectionism among the gifted may be a product of differential labeling patterns of similar behaviors when demonstrated by gifted students and the general cohort. A greater distinction between perfectionistic striving's which stimulate excellence and those perfectionistic strivings which frustrate and inhibit achievement needs to be made.",673.0,The incidence of perfectionism in gifted students,1996.0
"Gender differences in mathematics and the sciences: Can attributional retraining improve the performance of gifted females?   There are probably no subject areas in which the problem of reducing gender differences is as urgent as in mathematics and the ha;rd sciences. In this article, we provide a topical overview of the participation rates of girls and women in schools and. universities, an emphasis on the situation in Germany. We then discuss several attempts to explain these differences and show that until recently not enough attention has been paid to the girls' and women's self-related cognitions in these domains. They underestimate their own talents in mathematics and the sciences and, from a motivational perspective, attribute their successes and failures in such a way as to further inhibit motivation. Attributional retraining techniques could provide a solution to the problems of lowered motivation and performance. These retraining techniques have proved successful in clinical and laboratory settings, but they have not been tried in natural settings like schools and universities. Following an overview of the most important attributional retraining techniques, we describe two studies carried out with German high school students in mathematics and with female university students in statistics. Using an attributional retraining technique we developed, both studies report extremely promising results. Finally, on the basis of these studies, suggestions for further research are made.",674.0,Gender differences in mathematics and the sciences: Can attributional retraining improve the performance of gifted females?,1996.0
"Gifted and non-selected children's perceptions of academic achievement, academic effort, and athleticism   The purpose of the study was to examine gifted and non-selected children's perceptions of academic achievement, academic effort, and athleticism. 62 gifted and 61 non-selected 8 to 14-year-old children rated a series of hypothetical male and female characters differing in the aforementioned traits, Repeated-measures ANOVAs indicated that academic achievement and athleticism were important determinants of a character's acceptance, but that academic effort was not. We hypothesized that gifted children would view brilliant and studious characters more positively than would non-selected children. Gifted and non-selected children did not differ in their perceptions of studious characters, but marginal support was revealed for the contention that gifted children would be more accepting of brilliant characters than would non-selected children.",675.0,"Gifted and non-selected children's perceptions of academic achievement, academic effort, and athleticism",1996.0
"Research on motivation and the gifted: Implications for identification, programming, and evaluation   Much research on motivation and the gifted has tended to look at motivational characteristics of the gifted, either describing sti?dents in terms of their type or level of motivation, or comparing gifted students to others. Other research on this topic considers motivation as an outcome measure of programs or curricula for the gifted, for example determining if program participation increases student interest in a particular field. The former body of research may have the most practical use for understanding and identifications,for instructional strategy decisions and for program evaluation.",676.0,"Research on motivation and the gifted: Implications for identification, programming, and evaluation",1996.0

"Using the Purdue three-stage model to facilitate local program evaluations   Program evaluations conducted by district staff for the purpose of providing feedback to local decision makers are necessary for program improvement and accountability (Fetterman, 1993) and can facilitate the creation of longitudinal data bases on the outcomes of gifted and talented programs. This research and development project was undertaken to design, implement, and evaluate a year-long staff development program to improve the evaluation skills of the participants. The Purdue Three-Stage Model (Feldhusen & Kolloff, 1978; Moon, 1994) was used as the theoretical framework for the training program developed. Results suggest that the self-evaluation training was effective in helping coordinators become more skilled program evaluators. Implications of the project for program evaluation, training of program administrators, and longitudinal research on the outcomes of gifted and talented programs are discussed.",680.0,Using the Purdue three-stage model to facilitate local program evaluations,1996.0
"Identification, instruction and assessment of gifted children: A construct validation of a triarchic model   This article presents a unified model - the triarchic theory of human intelligence - for the identification, instruction, and assessment of the achievement of gifted children. The article opens with a discussion of the need for a unified model of identification, instruction, and assessment. The triarchic model is then offered as one potential model. Next the article discusses how the triarchic model could be implemented in a variety of subject matter areas. Finally, it describes a construct-validation of the model in the context of one subject matter area, college-level psychology taught to high-school students. The results show promise for the models use in gifted education. Students performed better when their triarchic ability pattern was matched, rather than mismatched to instruction and assessment.",681.0,"Identification, instruction and assessment of gifted children: A construct validation of a triarchic model",1996.0
"Assessment of leadership in children, youth and adults   Current theories of leadership are reviewed, Eleven leadership measures, six for children and youth and five for adults, are reviewed in the context of these theories and with psychometric standards for test use. In general, the measures are normed inadequately and lack information about reliability and validity. The use of short subscales embedded within other scales, which themselves often are inadequate, should be avoided. Currently, we lack the assessment technology to measure leadership adequately in children and youth. Leadership measures for adults are more promising, especially the Leadership Opinion Questionnaire, the Supervisory Behavior Description Questionnaire, and the Campbell Leadership Index.",682.0,"Assessment of leadership in children, youth and adults",1996.0
"Identifying cognitively gifted ethnic minority children   Four hundred kindergarten children in regular education and 31 kindergarten children identified as gifted were presented a cognitive battery consisting of nine different tasks. Five measures representing the three open-ended tasks were associated with both a significant group difference and the presence of high performing outliers from the regular education sample. When frequency distributions for the two groups were computed based on a total score summed over the five measures, seven of the eight regular education students with the highest score, the upper 2%, were either Black/NonHispanic or White/Hispanic. The upper 2% of the regular education sample performed at a level above 81% of the gifted sample. The data suggest that using a child's performance on a cognitive battery may prove to be effective for identifying gifted minority children who have not previously been identified as having superior cognitive abilities.",683.0,Identifying cognitively gifted ethnic minority children,1996.0

"Interface between gifted education and general education: Toward communication, cooperation and collaboration   Gifted education has often seemed isolation from general education, in part because of differing perspectives on equity and excellence goals and tensions resulting from those divergent viewpoints. Recently, however, there have been calls from both educators of the gifted and general educators for an increased interface between the two fields. This article reports findings and suggestions from a study conducted by a task force commissioned by the National Association of Gifted Children to determine attitudes of educators of the gifted and general educators regarding linkage between the practices, and to provide guidance from practitioners in both fields on increasing communication, cooperation and collaboration between the fields.",686.0,"Interface between gifted education and general education: Toward communication, cooperation and collaboration",1996.0

Characteristics of experts are discussed, leading to a consideration of the appropriateness of using adult experts' performance to measure children's performance. The use of a priori classifications of children is explored, and the suggestion for examining the use of gifted students' performances as benchmarks is presented. Both positive and negative consequences are described.",690.0,Expert benchmarks for student academic performance: The case for gifted children,1996.0
"Anchoring assessment with exemplars: Why students and teachers need models   This essay presents an argument for the use of examples that set a clear standard for student performance. As educators implement new forms of assessments, they should calibrate local standards to exemplars, anchoring the highest point of their scoring system to examples of excellent performance. educators should not be fearful of describing superlative performance even though all students may not reach those expert levels. four types of performance criteria are suggested: impact, process, form and content. Examples of assessment initiatives grounded in models of excellent performance are also summarized.",691.0,Anchoring assessment with exemplars: Why students and teachers need models,1996.0
"A fraction is not a piece of pie: Assessing exceptional performance and deep understanding in elementary school mathematics   The purpose of this study was to investigate how exceptional performance representing deep understanding of mathematical concepts might be assessed in the classroom or in larger scale assessment contexts. The study focused on several types of assessment based on cognitive analysis of fractions: problem solving, justification, and explanation tasks. Additional assessments, including propositional and procedural knowledge measures, provided validation data. Data were collected from 540 fifth grade students. To score at the highest levels, students had to show that they understood that fractions are numbers that can express relations between quantities, or at least that they had taken major steps toward such a conceptualization. Overall, student performance was consistent with that obtained in many other research and assessment studies. Fewer than 10% of the students performed adequately on the explanation task. More than 60% of the students failed to express any fraction principle or concept in their explanations, and 54% expressed serious misconceptions. A small number of students, however, displayed exceptional understanding. The effective-additional reason for optimism: students who received seven days of instruction on fractions in measurement contexts performed better on the explanation task than students who received traditional part-whole instruction. This result, in addition tasks were strongly associated with the expression of conceptual or principled knowledge in explanations, supported the use of the explanation task to assess understanding of concepts and principles.",692.0,A fraction is not a piece of pie: Assessing exceptional performance and deep understanding in elementary school mathematics,1996.0
"Wherefore art thou, multiple intelligences? Alternative assessments for identifying talent in ethnically diverse and low income students   The recent popularity of Multiple Intelligences (MI) theory corresponds with current efforts to move away from the use of standardized measures of achievement and ability to more authentic assessment techniques, including portfolio and performance-based assessment. Gardner and his colleagues have strongly encouraged the application of MI theory to performance-based assessment. This study investigates the reliability and validity of a battery of instruments based on MI theory, including teacher checklists and performance-based assessment activities. The purpose in developing the instruments was the identification of talent in culturally diverse and/or low income kindergarten and first grade students. Results suggest acceptable evidence of reliability but raise questions about the validity of the assessments. This study has implications for both future research efforts and the application of MI-based, performance measures to the assessment and identification of talent.",693.0,"Wherefore art thou, multiple intelligences?

"Talent beyond words: Identification of potential talent in dance and music in elementary students   We present evidence for the reliability and validity of the Talent Identification Instrument (TII), an observation process in music and dance in which multiple judges rate students throughout a multisession audition. The approach was designed to recognize previously overlooked abilities in urban elementary students, including low income, bilingual, and special education students. The TII observation process was designed to evoke artful behaviors that can be readily recognized by arts specialists and classroom teachers. We found strong agreement among raters and adequate stability estimates. Evidence for validity was obtained through factor analysis and a variety of construct validity procedures. The performance-based assessment described here may have implications for discovering hidden potential in academic as well as artistic domains.",694.0,Talent beyond words: Identification of potential talent in dance and music in elementary students,1996.0

"Academic survivability in high-potential, middle school students   Although researchers have found that students of all ability levels are bored in school, high-potential students are especially affected by a lack of challenge in the classroom. Few studies investigate the behaviors in which high-potential students engage when they are not challenged, and these studies are either of limited focus or do not include middle school students in their sample. Qualitative methodology was used to determine the behaviors and strategies used by 12 high-potential, middle school students when they did not feel challenged in school; teacher reaction to these behaviors was also documented. Data analysis revealed that students engaged in the following behaviors: selective attention, focused curricular involvement, involvement with others, participation in extracurricular activities, and lack of effort/selected effort. Few teachers associated these behaviors with a lack of challenge, and those who recognized the behaviors did not attempt to differentiate the learning process for the students.",700.0,"Academic survivability in high-potential, middle school students",1996.0
"Self-concept and sex-role orientation in gifted high school students   This study examined sex-role orientation and self-concept in a sample of 39 (22 males, 17 females) high school students enrolled in a gifted challenge program, and a control group matched on gender and grade. No effect of gender or program was found for sex-role orientation or global self-concept. Analysis of domain-specific aspects of self-concept, however, revealed that gifted students are more anxious and less satisfied with life than regular program students, and that female students are more anxious but better behaved than male students. Individuals with an undifferentiated sex-role orientation were found to core lowest on global self-concept and certain domain-specific aspects of self-concept, especially in comparision with masculine and androgynous individuals. Finally, the relationship between sex-role orientation and self-concept (general as well as domain-specific) was found to be consistent across program and gender.",701.0,Self-concept and sex-role orientation in gifted high school students,1996.0
"Should self-nominations be allowed in peer nomination forms?   The present study addressed the problem of slef-nominations in peer nomination forms (PNF) used with children to designate classroom peers who have superior abilities or talents. Its goal was to assess the incidence and worth of that information. The sample consisted of 391 students from 17 classes, almost evenly divided by gender and grade (4 to 8). The instrument was a 12-item PNF. Results revealed that self-nominations were very frequent (41%). A repeated measures ANOVA showed that the incidence rate was mainly influenced by the type of ability assessed and the rank of the choices, and that both interacted with the following variables: group, grade level, and gender. Self-nominations had no perceptible impact on the reliability of the talent scores. Self and peer nominations were significantly correlated, z = .44. A much lower correlation was observed between self- and teacher nominations, r = .23, attributed mainly to the lower reliability of these two types of scores.",702.0,Should self-nominations be allowed in peer nomination forms?,1996.0
"The structure of giftedness: The domain of literature as an exemplar   The construct validity of the 4 x 4 Structure of Giftedness Model in which giftedness is conceptualized in terms of four categories, i.e., general intellectual ability, specific intellectual ability, general original/creative thinking, and specific creative talent, was investigated in boys and girls in grades 7 to 9 (n = 392) and grades 10 to 12 (n = 381). Students were not limited to those with high IQ scores but rather represented the wide range of abilities and talents postulated by current multidimensional conceptualizations of giftedness. Six alternative models were evaluated and compared with respect to a number of goodness-of-fit indices to determine which model fit the data best. The best fit was the four-factor model, the current hypothesized model of the structure of giftedness in the domain of literature. These results contribute to the conceptual clarification of the diverse abilities that characterize intellectually and creatively gifted individuals, particularly those whose talents lie in the verbal domain.",703.0,The structure of giftedness: The domain of literature as an exemplar,1996.0

Although evidence can be presented to support the belief that a fundamental paradigm shift is occurring or has occurred, certain cultural, ethnic, and linguistic minority students continue to be underrepresented in special programs. Research and literature are reviewed to support the thesis that new identification procedures, new curricular and instructional programs, appropriate criteria for evaluating identification procedures, and changes in beliefs and stereotypes are needed to resolve the problem of underrepresentation and to accomplish needed changes. A conceptual framework, definition of giftedness, and an identification process consistent with the definition are discussed.
