"A report on the 40-year follow-up of the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking: Alive and well in the new millennium   This article updates information about the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking (TTCT) by reporting on predictive validity data from the most recent data collection point in Torrance's longitudinal studies. First, we outline the background of the tests and changes in scoring over the years. Then,. we detail the results of the analyses of the 40-year follow-up on the TTCT resulting in a structural equation model, which demonstrates the validity of the TTCT for predicting creative achievement 40 years after its administration. Finally, we provide a rationale for the relevance of the test in schools today.",392.0,A report on the 40-year follow-up of the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking: Alive and well in the new millennium,2005.0
"Outcomes to creativity training programs   How much confidence, based on recent research evidence, can educators have in using creativity training programs in their classrooms? In general, little research has been done since the significant reviews conducted 5 years ago, and much of the research is inaccessible to teachers. Research continues to focus primarily on using strategies in classrooms. Some research is beginning to look at aspects of the creative person, product, and environment, but more could be done to look at the interactions among these. The continued emphasis on classroom strategies raises concerns about the failure by researchers to address issues of strategy transfer to other environments.",393.0,Outcomes to creativity training programs,2005.0
"The creative personality   The study of the creative personality has established itself as a major avenue of research on creativity and creative problem solving, other areas being creative process, product, and environment (or press). With respect to personality research, over the past 50-plus years, many studies have examined characteristics, attitudes, preferences, styles, and other personal qualities that appear to distinguish highly creative individuals. The purposes of this article are to review the accumulated body of creative personality research; describe the works of a few major researchers and their methods; briefly review theories that have been offered to explain why these personal qualities are causes, correlates, and/or outcomes of the creative process; and examine the relatively new construct of creative and problem-solving styles. Style assessment builds upon traditional personality research but holds substantial promise for talent identification and development for all individuals, not just those recognized as creatively gifted.",394.0,The creative personality,2005.0
"A reexamination of brainstorming research: Implications for research and practice   Brainstorming may be the best-known tool for group idea generation and is widely taught in gifted and talented programs. Many empirical studies have been conducted regarding the effectiveness of brainstorming, and they have provided useful insights into the salient barriers facing groups who use this tool. Although a great deal of this literature focuses on the limitations of brainstorming, the exploratory study included in this article sheds light on approaches that can enhance the value of this tool by examining the impact of the facilitator's role within group idea generation. Finally, this article outlines recommendations for teaching, learning, and applying brainstorming.",395.0,A reexamination of brainstorming research: Implications for research and practice,2005.0
"Creative problem solving with marginalized populations: Reclaiming lost prizes through in-the-trenches interventions   This article describes several initiatives in which Creative Problem Solving, in combination with career exploration and mentoring, has been used successfully to identify and develop the talents of at-risk populations. During the past decade, the Lost Prizes project helped turn around the lives of talented but troubled high-school dropouts, Northern Lights encouraged productivity in disenfranchised Aboriginal teens, and Second Chance reduced recidivism among Native Canadian inmates. Currently, various mentoring programs are providing support to vulnerable inner-city young people at risk for alienation, school failure, and gang involvement.",396.0,Creative problem solving with marginalized populations: Reclaiming lost prizes through in-the-trenches interventions,2005.0
"Creative problem solving: The history, development, and implications for gifted education and talent development   This article presents a summary of research, development, and applications of Creative Problem Solving (CPS) in educational settings and, more specifically, in gifted education. The CPS framework is widely known and applied as one important goal in contemporary gifted education, as well as in relation to initiatives for teaching thinking in the broader context of general education. This article traces the history and evolution of the CPS framework through more than five decades of research, development, and practical application. We describe and discuss the specific changes in the model over time, as well as their rationale and foundations. We discuss the implications of changes within the CPS framework for teaching and learning; our purpose is not to compare or contrast CPS with other perspectives on creativity from psychology, cognitive science, or management. Finally, we present implications of contemporary CPS for instruction and assessment in gifted education.",397.0,"Creative problem solving: The history, development, and implications for gifted education and talent development",2005.0

"Identifying cognitively gifted minority students in preschool   Preschool children were administered a screening battery consisting of nine different cognitive tasks. The participants were tracked in the public school database. Based on the children's first-grade educational status, 2 groups were formed: one consisting of children who were in regular education and the other composed of children who were in the gifted/talented program. The children's preschool screening scores, summed over both the identification-tasks subset and the generating-tasks subset, enabled the identification of high-performing outliers from the regular education sample who performed very well compared to the school-identified gifted sample. However, a majority of minority students among the high-performing outliers were only identified with the generating measure. The superior first-grade achievement performance of 5 of these 7 and the finding that 3 of the 7 had been placed in the gifted program in second grade, attested to the effectiveness of this measure for identifying cognitively gifted minority preschoolers.",402.0,Identifying cognitively gifted minority students in preschool,2005.0
"Family environment and talent development of Chinese gifted students in Hong Kong   This study assessed the self-perceptions of 432 gifted students regarding their family environments and their talent areas. Family environmental variables included parental expectations to achieve, parents' encouragement to be independent, and family cohesion. Talent areas included academic skills, creativity, and leadership. The conjectures that academic achievement could be enhanced by parental expectations, as well as family cohesion, and that creativity could be enhanced by encouragement to be independent were not fully supported by the regression analyses. However, family environmental variables did predict students' perceived talent areas, especially in leadership, and family cohesion was the consistent significant predictor. Implications of the findings are discussed with reference to cross-cultural research, but caution needs to be exercised in the interpretation of these results, as data were collected only on student perceptions.",403.0,Family environment and talent development of Chinese gifted students in Hong Kong,2005.0
"A dynamic scaffolding model of teacher development: The gifted education consultant as catalyst for change   The Dynamic Scaffolding Model (DSM) of teacher development is proposed as a good way to meet gifted learners' exceptional learning needs while remaining consistent with current educational realities and research. Using an implementation experience as an illustration, we examine how a gifted education consultant can support teachers in addressing the diverse educational needs of high-ability learners in their classrooms, as well as encouraging high-level outcomes in learners not identified as gifted, leading to classrooms that are more engaging for both students and teachers. In this model, teachers are given opportunities for scaffolded learning and interaction in the form of (a) a series of optional professional development workshops on giftedness, (b) ongoing and targeted individual consultation opportunities, and (c) diverse professional liaisons. We compare the DSM with other resource consultation models, and we discuss characteristics identified by participating teachers as important in their work with gifted learners and others.",404.0,A dynamic scaffolding model of teacher development: The gifted education consultant as catalyst for change,2005.0
"Factors that contribute to talented performance: A theoretical model from a Chinese perspective   This paper examines the Chinese literature on giftedness and talented performance (TP) and compares its dominant theoretical features with some influential models to be found in the North American literature. One significant feature to emerge from the Chinese literature is a deemphasis on giftedness as an innate ability and an emphasis on the concept of talented performance. Such a finding is congruent with a Confucian cultural outlook that encourages effort, rather than the identification of giftedness. In order to test this finding against the perceptions of Chinese educators, a preliminary study was carried out involving 14 secondary school teachers. The results confirmed the findings from the literature survey, suggesting that these teachers' perceptions conformed to a model of TP with a developmental conception as its central organizing feature. It is hoped that the implications of this study will contribute to the practice of gifted and talented education in China and will also provide basic theoretical grounds for further research.",405.0,Factors that contribute to talented performance: A theoretical model from a Chinese perspective,2005.0
"An evaluation of the elementary student talent search by families and schools   Talent searches for seventh and eighth graders have extensive empirical support, and the model has been successfully extended to elementary students. Research has focused on participants earning high scores on above-level tests, however, not typical participants. Here, 597 families and 93 schools that participated in the Carnegie Mellon Institute for Talented Elementary Students (C-MITES) Elementary Student Talent Search (ESTS) completed follow-up surveys designed to measure the typical participant's satisfaction with the program and use of test scores. Families were very satisfied with their ESTS experience, but above-level test scores were not often used by schools. The most corm-non use of the scores was to qualify students for extracurricular programs. School personnel appear to lack understanding of the information to be gained from above-level test scores despite literature provided to them by the talent searches. Talent search organizations need to find creative ways of educating schools about their services so that benefits to all participants can be maximized.",406.0,An evaluation of the elementary student talent search by families and schools,2005.0
"Do gifted student writers and creative writing experts rate creativity the same way?   Little research has been conducted on how gifted novices compare to experts in their judgments of creative writing. If novices and experts assign similar ratings, it could be argued that gifted novices are able to offer their peers feedback of a similar quality to that provided by experts. Such a finding would support the use of collaborative feedback in gifted classrooms. We asked gifted high school creative writers and three groups of experts (cognitive psychologists, creative writers, and teachers) to rate a set of 27 short stories and 28 poems for creativity using a scale of 1 to 6. The interrater agreement among the novices was within acceptable standards, and the agreement among the experts was very strong. When the ratings of novices were compared to the ratings of experts, a strong degree of correlation was found, supporting the use of peer feedback among gifted novice creative writers.",407.0,Do gifted student writers and creative writing experts rate creativity the same way?,2005.0

"The important role of optimism in a motivational investigation of the education of gifted adolescents   Intellectually gifted 7(th)-grade students were surveyed approximately halfway through their 1(st) year of high school in order to investigate relationships between motivational and affective variables, commitment to schoolwork, and satisfaction with school. The results of the confirmatory factor analyses and structural equation modeling suggest that relationships of mediatng variables such as optimism, strain on coping resources, extrinsic motivation, and intrinsic motivation with satisfaction with school and commitment to schoolwork should be considered in the context of the motivational needs of gifted students.",411.0,The important role of optimism in a motivational investigation of the education of gifted adolescents,2005.0
"The role of nonverbal ability tests in identifying academically gifted students: An aptitude perspective   The first goal of,this article is to discuss the role-of nonverbal ability tests in the identification of academically gifted children. I note that most nonverbal tests measure verbally mediated cognitive processes, that they are neither culture free nor culture fair, and that we have known these facts for a very long time. I show that selecting students for gifted and talented programs on the basis of such tests would exclude, the majority of the most academically accomplished students in all ethnic groups. The second goal is to propose abetter method for identifying gifted students. I argue that the critical issue is readiness for a particular type of educational opportunity. The cognitive aspects of readiness are evidence first in students levels of knowledge and skill in particular. domains and secondarily in their abilities to reason in the symbol systems used to communicate new knowledge in these domains. This applies to both, minority and majority students. Therefore, the most, academically talented minority students are those who show the strongest current achievement in particular domains and the best ability to reason in the symbol systems required for the acquisition of new knowledge in those domains. I also argue that, although current accomplishment can be measured on a common scale, judgments about potential must always be made relative to circumstances.",412.0,The role of nonverbal ability tests in identifying academically gifted students: An aptitude perspective,2005.0
"From noncompetance of exceptional talent: Exploring the range of academic achievement within and between grade levels   This article analyzes the magnitude of individual differences in: academic achievement and their growth over the first 9 years of schooling. The author anchors the widening-gap phenomenon on the theoretical recognition of large individual differences in learning pace, which logically leads over time to an increasing gap in, knowledge and skills between the fastest and slowest learners. The achievement data used as evidence were borrowed from the developmental standard score (SS) norms of the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills (ITBS; Hoover, Dunbar, & Frisbie, 2001). These norms reveal, among other things, that within most grade, levels the range between the lowest and highest achievers exceeds the 8-year gap in knowledge between average 1st- and 9th-grade students. Moreover, the achievement gap widens by about 145% between: grades 1 and 9. Parallel evidence suggests that standardized achievement test data probably underestimate the true differences. Because it ensues from stable individual differences in learning aptitude, educators should not perceive that widening achievement gap as a failure of the educational system, but should recognize it instead as a proof that all learners are given the opportunity to progress'. at, their own learning pace.",413.0,From noncompetance of exceptional talent: Exploring the range of academic achievement within and between grade levels,2005.0
"Radical acceleration and early entry to college: A review of the research   Radical acceleration is a successful, yet rarely utilized educational practice that assists educators in meeting the cognitive and affective needs of highly gifted students. Individual case studies and cohort studies of students who have radically accelerated are reviewed regarding combinations of procedures that result in successful acceleration, variables that appear to predict success and cognitive and affective outcomes. While research supports the use of radical acceleration for the positive cognitive and affective gains that result for highly gifted students some concerns about the process have been identified. An outline is presented of procedures that have been shown to lessen the likelihood of unfavourable outcomes. These procedures include counseling support, study skills programs, and opportunities to foster social interaction with other students. The literature concerning radical acceleration strongly supports the wider adoption of this most successful intervention.",414.0,Radical acceleration and early entry to college: A review of the research,2005.0
"Educational characteristics of adolescents with gifted academic intrinsic motivation: A longitudinal investigation from school entry through early adulthood   The construct of gifted motivation was examined in a contemporary, long-term, longitudinal investigation. Adolescents with extremely high academic intrinsic motivation (i.e., gifted motivation) were compared to their cohort peer comparison on a variety of educationally relevant measures from elementary school through the early adulthood years. Assessment of academic intrinsic motivation was based on the Children's Academic Intrinsic Motivation Inventory. Cross-time, pervasive differences resulted favoring the gifted motivation compared to the cohort comparison group on motivation, achievement, classroom functioning, intellectual performance, self-concept, and postsecondary education talk progress. Meaningful effect sizes were obtained and corroborated by teachers' observations. Gifted motivation proved to be distinct from gifted intelligence. This research serves to expand the definition of giftedness to include the construct of gifted motivation in its own right. These findings have implications for identifying students with gifted motivation for entry into programs for the gifted.",415.0,Educational characteristics of adolescents with gifted academic intrinsic motivation: A longitudinal investigation from school entry through early adulthood,2005.0

"Predictors of learned helplessness among average and mildly gifted girls and boys attending initial high school physics instruction in Germany   In mathematics, physics, and chemistry, women are still considered to be at a disadvantage. In the present study, the development of the symptoms of learned helplessness was of particular interest. A study involving average and mildly gifted 8th-grade boys and girls (top 6%) investigated whether girls, regardless of ability level, experience helplessness in introductory physics courses more intensely than their male counterparts. Contrary to current research findings, no particular disadvantages for gifted girls could be isolated. In total, 7 explanatory approaches to helplessness were examined by regression analysis: the talent deficit hypothesis, the prior physics knowledge deficit hypothesis, the self-confidence deficit hypothesis, the modification deficit hypothesis, the interest deficit hypothesis, the anxiety hypothesis, and the control deficit hypothesis. On the basis of these findings, approaches to assist in the development of interventions are suggested.",417.0,Predictors of learned helplessness among average and mildly gifted girls and boys attending initial high school physics instruction in Germany,2005.0
"Review of Naglieri and Ford (2003): Does the Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test identify equal proportions of high-scoring White, Black, and Hispanic students?   In a recent article in this journal, Naglieri and Ford (2003) claimed that Black and Hispanic students are as likely to earn high scores on the Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test (NNAT; Naglieri, 1997a) as White students. However, the sample that Naglieri and Ford used was not representative of the U.S. school population as a whole and was quite unrepresentative of ethnic subgroups within that population. For example, only 5.6% of the children in their sample were from urban school districts, and both Black and Hispanic students were relatively more likely to be from high socioeconomic status (SES) families than were White families. Further, the mean and standard deviation in the sample differed significantly from the NNAT fall test norms, which were based on the same data. Finally, White-Black and White-Hispanic differences reported by Naglieri and Ford were smaller than those reported by Naglieri and Ronning (2000a) in a previous analysis of the same data set in which students were first matched on several demographic variables. For these reasons, I argue that the authors' claims not supported by the data they present.",418.0,"Review of Naglieri and Ford (2003): Does the Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test identify equal proportions of high-scoring White, Black, and Hispanic students?",2005.0
"Increasing minority children's participation in gifted classes using the NNAT: A response to Lohman   In a previous article, we (Naglieri & Ford, 2003) provided evidence from a large-scale study that similar proportions of White, Black, and Hispanic children would be identified as gifted using the Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test (NNAT; Naglieri, 1997). Lohman (2005) has taken issue with our conclusions and our methods. We provide several responses to his arguments and make five important points. First, we take the position that underrepresentation of minority children in classes for the gifted is a serious problem that must be remedied. Second, traditional measures of ability that include verbal and quantitative tests pose particular problems to less-advantaged children who may be intelligent, but lack verbal and math knowledge. Third, we argue that the CogAT verbal and quantitative tests of ability correlate higher with the ITBS achievement tests than the CogAT nonverbal tests of ability because of the similarity of skills needed to answer the items on both the ITBS and the CogAT. Fourth, we reject an emphasis on academically gifted children that excludes the identification of intellectually gifted children who happen to have poor academic skills. Fifth, we request that critics of the NNAT provide evidence of the magnitude of race and ethnic differences, as well as the likely effect on representation of minorities using whatever alternative they propose.",419.0,Increasing minority children's participation in gifted classes using the NNAT: A response to Lohman,2005.0
"Investigation of high school credit and placement for summer coursework taken outside of local schools   This study examined how local schools responded to students' outside-of-school summer courses, particularly regarding the awarding of credit and appropriate placement. It involved 262 middle and high school administrators of students who had attended a gifted summer program at a local university. Survey data showed the critical influence of the school's policies on granting credit for outside-of-school coursework and institutional accreditation on the school's responses. For high schools, territory or administrative issues such as the school's own policy on credit, prior notice of a student's participation in the program, sharing outside-of-school course syllabi with school officials in advance, the type of course, and accreditation of the summer program were crucial in decisions regarding the awarding of credit. For middle schools, the school's own evaluation of a student's mastery of the course content, prior notice of the student's participation in the program, and the student's performance in the outside-of-school course were the most significant factors that affected schools' responses regarding appropriate placement. Findings showed that schools' responses were conservative and that parents need to petition more actively for credit or placement for their children.",420.0,Investigation of high school credit and placement for summer coursework taken outside of local schools,2005.0
"Recruitment is not enough: Retaining African American students in gifted education   In public school systems all around the country, educators-teachers, counselors, and administrators- have made significant progress in identifying and recruiting diverse populations in gifted and enrichment programs. Despite the efforts, too many African American students and other students of color (e.g., Hispanic Americans and Native Americans) are not faring well in gifted education. The social and cultural obstacles (e.g., racial and ethnic prejudice, negative peer pressure, poor parental involvement, negative teacher and counselor expectations, etc.) that students of color, particularly African Americans, face in gifted education are well known. In order to improve African American student retention, it is clear that public school systems must do more. Recruitment is an important component for increasing the number of African American students in gifted education, but retention is equally important.

Respondents indicated the degree to which they agreed or disagreed with 20 items that reflected guidelines for a comprehensive identification system. Five factors were derived from 20 items. Respondents favored the use of individual expression criteria, ongoing assessment, multiple criteria for identification, and consideration of contextual factors. Teachers of the gifted and respondents from urban areas were more likely to favor these strategies.
