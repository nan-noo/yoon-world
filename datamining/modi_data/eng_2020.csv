"Reducing Levels of Perfectionism in Gifted and Talented Youth Through a Mindfulness Intervention adolescents; ANOVA; MANOVA; mindfulness; perfectionism; quasi-experimental Gifted youth frequently experience perfectionism, which for some can affect their emotional well-being. This study evaluated the effectiveness of a 6-week mindfulness intervention for 42 middle school students who were identified as Gifted and Talented. Participants' levels of self-oriented and socially prescribed perfectionism, as well as their use of mindfulness practices, were evaluated pre- and post- intervention, as well as at a 5-week follow-up to assess changes in perfectionism ratings and use of mindfulness. Three Bonferroni-adjusted, one-way, repeated measures analyses of variance were performed, and the results indicated a significant decrease in self-oriented perfectionism and an increase in mindfulness at both the end of the intervention and at follow-up. These findings support the use of mindfulness as an appropriate intervention to reduce self-imposed forms of perfectionism among gifted youth.",6.0,Reducing Levels of Perfectionism in Gifted and Talented Youth Through a Mindfulness Intervention,2020.0
"Similarities and Differences Between Intellectually Gifted and Average-Ability Students in School Performance, Motivation, and Subjective Well-Being giftedness; ability self-concept; vocational interests; academic achievement Terman's study was the first to systematically document the lives of the intellectually gifted. This cross-sectional study replicates and extends some of Terman's findings on characteristics of the gifted in childhood, comparing largely unselected samples of gifted (n = 50) and average-ability (n = 50) adolescents matched by means of propensity score matching. Students were compared on their school performance (standardized math and reading tests and grades), motivation (math ability self-concept, intrinsic motivation, vocational interests, and educational aspirations), parental educational expectations, students' evaluation of school instruction (perceived quality and pressure), and subjective well-being. The gifted scored higher on math performance (rank-biserialr = .66/.81), math ability self-concept (.71), intrinsic motivation (.62), and investigative vocational interests (.65). Some smaller differences were found for realistic (.42) and social interests (-.37) and for pressure in math lessons (-.52). Results support Terman's findings on gifted individuals' psychological functioning and contradict negative stereotypes about the gifted.",7.0,"Similarities and Differences Between Intellectually Gifted and Average-Ability Students in School Performance, Motivation, and Subjective Well-Being",2020.0
"Test-Taking for Gifted and Talented Kindergarten: Underscoring the Importance of Outreach diversity; access and equity; gifted identification; information dissemination; matching methods; mixed effects logistic regression; observational study Using proprietary data collected prior to the establishment of the public Universal Prekindergarten program in New York City, this study finds statistically significant differences in test-taking rates for the city's Gifted & Talented (G & T) program between two matched samples of students-those who attended a public prekindergarten (pre-K) program and those who did not-for each of four cohorts from 2008 to 2011, favoring the public pre-K group. Results also demonstrate that access to information about the G & T program is a plausible mechanism underlying the higher test-taking rates among the public pre-K group, especially for underrepresented groups. With the establishment of the Universal Prekindergarten in New York City in 2015, our results highlight the importance of instituting new policies for promoting the dissemination of information regarding the G & T admissions process within the public school sector. If targeted to address diversity in G & T, such policies could help reduce inequality in gifted education.",8.0,Test-Taking for Gifted and Talented Kindergarten: Underscoring the Importance of Outreach,2020.0
"Factors Associated With Gifted Identification for Ethnically Diverse Children in Poverty achievement gap; diversity; excellence gap; gifted identification We analyzed data from a large-scale (N= 39,213), longitudinal study of urban students to assess child factors (gender, ethnicity, English language learner status, school readiness skills, type of pre-K attended, early elementary school academic performance) prospectively associated with eventual gifted identification in elementary school. Overall, 14.2% of students were identified as gifted in K-5th grade, with the majority identified by second grade. Multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that White and Latino students were more likely to be identified as gifted than Black students, even controlling for poverty and early academic performance. English language learners, boys, and those who attended public school pre-K programs were more likely to be identified controlling for other factors. School readiness assessments were also useful for predicting giftedness.",9.0,Factors Associated With Gifted Identification for Ethnically Diverse Children in Poverty,2020.0
"What's in Your Gifted Education Online Teacher Professional Development? Incorporating Theory- and Practice-Based Elements of Instructional Learning Design distance education; gifted; mixed methods; professional development; survey research; teacher education This article examined six theory- and practice-based elements of instructional learning design in online teacher professional development (oTPD), how these elements were implemented into Edinger's PACKaGE model of gifted education oTPD, and how teachers evaluated each element. Elements were based on Berge's (1995) instructor roles model theory and gifted education research. Each element was evaluated by teachers (N= 184) who completed oTPD designed from the PACKaGE model. Self-report survey findings suggest that teachers considered most elements, such as asynchronous discussion board and article review assignments, to be useful to a great extent to their gifted education learning and pedagogy. However, teachers reported less usefulness for the online group project element. This finding directly contrasts with researchers' suggestions for oTPD. These findings may encourage teachers to choose theory- and research-based oTPD. PD designers can investigate and implement oTPD elements that satisfy instructional design model needs for optimal teacher learning and gifted education pedagogy.",10.0,What's in Your Gifted Education Online Teacher Professional Development?

"Galton, Terman, Cox: The Distinctive Volume II in Genetic Studies of Genius archival; biographical; historical analysis; early childhood; gifted; intelligence With just one exception, all of the volumes in Terman's Genetic Studies of Genius report the results of a longitudinal study of more than a thousand intellectually gifted children. That single exception is Volume II, Cox's single-authored The Early Mental Traits of Three Hundred Geniuses, which instead was a retrospective study of 301 eminent creators and leaders, using historiometric methods to estimate their IQs (as well as to assess a subset of 100 on 67 character traits). This article discusses how this volume actually fits with the other four volumes in the set. After giving the historical background, discussion turns to the emergence of Cox's doctoral dissertation. Then comes a narrative of the aftermath, including subsequent contributions by Cox, Terman, and numerous other researchers extending into the 21st century. The article closes by treating the ways that the intellectually gifted and the historic geniuses are not comparable, thus indicating the need for more recent replications and extensions of her work.",11.0,"Galton, Terman, Cox: The Distinctive Volume II in Genetic Studies of Genius",2020.0
"Factors Related to Suicidal Cognitions of Academically Gifted Students in the Chinese Social-Cultural Context: An Exploratory Study academically gifted; positive psychology; suicidal cognition; Chinese; social-cultural context; broaden-and-build theory From the perspective of positive psychology, this study examined the variables in four domains of personal resources under the broaden-and-build theory concerning their relationships with suicidal cognition among academically gifted students. A total of 386 academically gifted secondary school students in China participated in the study. First, the descriptive analysis results indicated that the mean score of suicidal cognition was below average, but these students were experiencing sleep deprivation problem in their daily lives. Second, based on the broaden-and-build theory, correlational analysis results suggested that most of the variables from the four domains of resources were significantly related to suicidal cognition. Most important, regression results showed that cognitive and psychological resources appeared to be the most influential for suicidal cognition. Furthermore, parents should be alerted that, for academically gifted students, parental relationship (social resource) is important, as lack of such a positive relationship (i.e., parents' alienation) showed strong negative effect on suicidal cognition of these students. This was the first study that used the framework of broaden-and-build theory to study and compare the predictive effects of resources on suicidal cognition of academically gifted secondary school students in the Chinese social and cultural contexts.",12.0,Factors Related to Suicidal Cognitions of Academically Gifted Students in the Chinese Social-Cultural Context: An Exploratory Study,2020.0
"Differences in Using the Cognitive Abilities Test (CogAT) 7 Nonverbal Battery Versus the Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test (NNAT) 2 to Identify the Gifted/Talented Cognitive Abilities Test; Naglieri Nonverbal Abilities Test; identification; nonverbal; school-level norming; local norming; group-specific norming; opportunity to learn The two most commonly used nonverbal tests for gifted identification, the Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test (NNAT) and the Cognitive Abilities Test (CogAT) nonverbal battery, have not been compared in their newer versions to explore the effects of their use on the identification of underserved populations. Additionally, the effects of the use of various norming groups and cutoff scores on both instruments' identification abilities has not been compared. This study compared 15,733 CogAT7 nonverbal battery scores and 14,421 NNAT2 scores of kindergartners between 2013 and 2015 from one large urban school district to explore the differences between how each test relates to major demographic variables and examine the effects on who is selected for participation in gifted programming based on which instrument, which norming group, and which cutoff scores are used. Both instruments were less likely to identify students from demographic groups that have been traditionally underrepresented than students from traditionally overrepresented demographic groups, but identification varied based on the type of norming plan used and which instrument was taken. Suggestions are made as to the best instrument for use with various demographic groups and norming plans.",13.0,Differences in Using the Cognitive Abilities Test (CogAT) 7 Nonverbal Battery Versus the Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test (NNAT) 2 to Identify the Gifted/Talented,2020.0
"Differentiating Among High-Achieving Learners: A Comparison of Classical Test Theory and Item Response Theory on Above-Level Testing item response theory; talent search; talent identification This study investigated the application of item response theory (IRT) to expand the range of ability estimates for gifted (hereinafter referred to as high-achieving) students' performance on an above-level test. Using a sample of fourth- to sixth-grade high-achieving students (N = 1,893), we conducted a study to compare estimates from two measurement theories, classical test theory (CTT) and IRT. CTT and IRT make different assumptions about the analysis that impact the reliability and validity of the scores obtained from the test. IRT can also differentiate students based on the student's grade or within a grade by using the unique string of correct and incorrect answers the student makes while taking the test. This differentiation may have implications for identifying or classifying students who are ready for advanced coursework. An exploration of the differentiation for Math, Reading, and Science tests and the impact the different measurement frameworks can have on classification of students are explored. Implications for academic talent identification with the talent search model and development of academic talent are discussed.",14.0,Differentiating Among High-Achieving Learners: A Comparison of Classical Test Theory and Item Response Theory on Above-Level Testing,2020.0
"Cyberbullying and Internet Addiction in Gifted and Nongifted Teenagers bullying; generalized linear models; gifted; Internet addiction The present article analyzed whether there are differences between gifted and nongifted teenagers in relation to cyberbullying (either as aggressor or victim) and to Internet addiction (in both the intrapersonal and interpersonal dimensions). Furthermore, the existing relationships between cyberbullying and Internet addiction were explored in a sample of gifted teenagers and their nongifted classmates. Participants were 122 adolescents between 13 and 17 years of age (M = 14.40), in compulsory secondary education, half of whom were considered gifted students. The data obtained through a matched case-control study design revealed no significant differences between gifted students and the rest of the students in terms of the incidence of cyberbullying and Internet addiction. Nevertheless, results from generalized linear models revealed the important role that interpersonal conflicts deriving from Internet addiction play in explaining situations of cyberbullying.",15.0,Cyberbullying and Internet Addiction in Gifted and Nongifted Teenagers,2020.0

"The Effectiveness of Current Interventions to Reverse the Underachievement of Gifted Students: Findings of a Meta-Analysis and Systematic Review underachievement interventions; gifted underachievers; academic achievement and psychosocial outcomes; motivation for learning meta-analysis and systematic review; reliability and validity; effect sizes Underachievement of gifted students has been a great concern for the field of gifted education. The current study reviewed 14 recent empirical studies concerning the effectiveness of underachievement interventions on gifted students' achievement outcomes and psychosocial outcomes. Overall, there was no evidence that underachievement interventions significantly improved academic performance of gifted underachievers (g = .09, p = .387), especially in terms of course grades. Gifted underachievers receiving interventions significantly outscored their comparison peers on psychosocial outcomes (g = 0.22, p = .001), which consisted of a variety of measures on self-efficacy, goal valuation, environmental perceptions, self-regulation/motivation, and psychosocial functioning. Qualitative studies generally reported that gifted underachievers benefited from the interventions in terms of increased motivation for learning, improved self-regulation, and finding school more meaningful. Findings need to be viewed in light of the relatively low quality of the evidence from recent research on underachievement interventions.",17.0,The Effectiveness of Current Interventions to Reverse the Underachievement of Gifted Students: Findings of a Meta-Analysis and Systematic Review,2020.0
"Gifted Students' Adjustment and Underachievement in University. An Exploration From the Self-Determination Theory Perspective adjustment; gifted students; motivation; underachievement Successful transition from school to university is essential for the academic success of any student. Gifted students might encounter unique challenges due to their characteristics, and there is an evidence that a failure to adjust to the demands of university environment has a negative effect on gifted students' academic performance, leading to underachievement. This qualitative study aimed at exploration of gifted students' adjustment to university and issues they face within this process. We use the lenses provided by self-determination theory to further interpret the role of both internal and external motivation forces contributing to gifted students' adjustment and achievement in higher education settings. It was identified that the gifted school and university learning environments, as well as the influence of key people (parents, peers, and teachers) played a crucial role in facilitating or impeding gifted school graduates' sense of self-determination and consequently their adjustment and achievement. This study offers interesting insights for the understanding of gifted (under)achievement in a context where giftedness is predominantly conceived as high intelligence and academic achievement, gifted students are identified via performance-based measures, specialized schools are the preferred means for gifted education, and young people's talents are considered invaluable for the development of the national economy and the society.",18.0,Gifted Students' Adjustment and Underachievement in University.

"Pay Attention to Inattention: Exploring ADHD Symptoms in a Sample of Underachieving Gifted Students ANOVA; MANOVA; attention deficit disorder; attention-deficient; hyperactivity disorder; gifted; motivation; underachievement Much has been written about the relationship of giftedness and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), as well as the relationship between ADHD and underachievement. The present study examined whether students who were identified as gifted underachievers were more likely to manifest symptoms of ADHD, as measured by the ADHD-IV. Over half of the gifted underachievers met the screening criteria for ADHD based on teacher reports, and almost 30% of the gifted underachievers met the screening criteria for ADHD based on parent reports. Most of these students had elevated scores on the inattention scale. The prevalence of inattention was over 2 times as high as the prevalence in the norming sample using the teacher rating scales and over 5 times as high as the prevalence in the norming sample using the parent rating scales. Although parents and teachers rated students similarly on the hyperactivity scale, teachers rated students as more inattentive than parents did. However, elevated parent ratings of inattention negatively predicted students' self-regulation, goal valuation, and self-efficacy. Self-regulation was most strongly related to inattention. We cannot know whether the gifted underachievers with high inattention scores have undiagnosed ADHD. However, our results suggest that a substantial percentage of gifted underachievers exhibit attentional problems at home, and that these attentional problems are severe enough to merit further examination.",19.0,Pay Attention to Inattention: Exploring ADHD Symptoms in a Sample of Underachieving Gifted Students,2020.0
"An Expectancy-Value Approach to Math Underachievement: Examining High School Achievement, College Attendance, and STEM Interest structural equation modeling; secondary data analysis Students' academic underachievement, defined as discrepancies between ability and academic performance, is a widespread problem leading to many negative consequences. Our study examines high school students' math underachievement, its motivational antecedents, and its impact on future math achievement, college attendance, and STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) interest. Using data from the nationally representative High School Longitudinal Study, we identified students who exhibited a math ability-achievement discrepancy between their standardized math scores at the beginning of ninth grade and their final math grade in fall of ninth grade. We then conducted generalized structural equation modeling to identify direct effects of math motivation on math underachievement along with the direct effects of math underachievement on future STEM and college outcomes. Informed by expectancy-value theory, we found that math motivation, as measured by value and expectancy beliefs was significantly associated with math underachievement. We also found that math underachievement was associated with a number of outcomes in the high school to college transition with evidence of moderation by high math ability. Implications for research, practice, and policy are discussed.",20.0,"An Expectancy-Value Approach to Math Underachievement: Examining High School Achievement, College Attendance, and STEM Interest",2020.0
"Telling a Tale: How Underachievement Develops in Gifted Girls gifted; underachievement; achievement motivation; narrative inquiry In this multiple-narrative inquiry, we examined the narratives of four underachieving gifted girls to identify aspects that appear to have contributed to the onset, development, and resolution of academic underachievement. We found that academic achievement was disrupted when the participants experienced a sudden increase in curricular demands when transitioning to middle or high school. Participants' negative self-perceptions, lack of learning skills, and negative relationships with teachers commonly contributed to the maintenance of the underachievement. Finally, the underachievement began to resolve when the girls had a clear goal in mind, which for three of them was being accepted to college.",21.0,Telling a Tale: How Underachievement Develops in Gifted Girls,2020.0
"Cognitive and Achievement Characteristics of Students From a National Sample Identified as Potentially Twice Exceptional (Gifted With a Learning Disability) academic achievement; cognitive abilities; descriptive; giftedness; learning disabilities It is important to identify cognitive and achievement characteristics that differentiate students who are twice exceptional because they are gifted and have a learning disability (2e-LD) from gifted and average ability peers because this information informs empirically-based identification and support systems for this population. In this study, I classified school-age participants (N = 3,865) in the nationally representative standardization sample for the Woodcock-Johnson IV (WJ IV) Tests of Cognitive Abilities and Achievement as potentially gifted, 2e-LD, or of average ability based on their WJ IV performance. I compared mean levels of performance, strengths and weaknesses, and intraindividual heterogeneity across 2e-LD, gifted, and average-ability groups. The 2e-LD group demonstrated greater heterogeneity in performance, and their strengths and weaknesses were largely consistent with past research and writing on 2e-LD characteristics. Results support some 2e-LD identification recommendations from the literature and highlight the potential benefits of individualized assessment, dual differentiation, and a de-emphasis of speeded academic tasks.",22.0,Cognitive and Achievement Characteristics of Students From a National Sample Identified as Potentially Twice Exceptional (Gifted With a Learning Disability),2020.0
"Supports for Youth in Accelerated High School Curricula: An Initial Study of Applicability and Acceptability of a Motivational Interviewing Intervention International Baccalaureate; mental health; mixed methods; motivation; secondary High school students in accelerated classes face heightened school-related stressors but have access to few specialized supports. This article describes the development and initial application of the Motivation, Assessment, and Planning (MAP) intervention, developed to meet the needs of freshmen in Advanced Placement (AP) and International Baccalaureate (IB) curricula. MAP is grounded in motivational interviewing and designed to evoke behavior change following one to two individual meetings with a coach. This study used a multimethod, multisource approach to evaluate the applicability and acceptability of MAP as a Tier 2 support for 9th-grade students completing AP/IB coursework. Quantitative and qualitative acceptability data from 49 AP/IB students, 7 coaches, and 3 potential end-users of MAP were examined. Results indicate MAP was perceived as an acceptable intervention for addressing the social-emotional needs of high-achieving students taking AP/IB classes. Findings and directions for further research of MAP are discussed.",23.0,Supports for Youth in Accelerated High School Curricula: An Initial Study of Applicability and Acceptability of a Motivational Interviewing Intervention,2020.0
"Making Meaning out of MANOVA: The Need for Multivariate Post Hoc Testing in Gifted Education Research MANOVA; discriminant analysis; multivariate analysis Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) is a statistical method used to examine group differences on multiple outcomes. This article reports results of a review of MANOVA in gifted education journals between 2011 and 2017 (N = 56). Findings suggest a number of conceptual and procedural misunderstandings about the nature of MANOVA and its application, including pervasive use of univariate post hoc tests to interpret MANOVA results. Accordingly, this article aims to make MANOVA more accessible to gifted education scholars by clarifying its purpose and introducing descriptive discriminant analysis as a more appropriate post hoc technique. A heuristic data set is used to demonstrate the procedures for running a descriptive discriminant analysis, both in place of a one-way MANOVA and as a post hoc analysis to a factorial design.

"MANOVA: A Procedure Whose Time Has Passed? MANOVA; ANOVA; Type I error; SEM; regression Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) is a statistical procedure commonly used in fields such as education and psychology. However, MANOVA's popularity may actually be for the wrong reasons. The large majority of published research using MANOVA focus on univariate research questions rather than on the multivariate questions that MANOVA is said to specifically address. Given the more complicated and limited nature of interpreting MANOVA effects (which researchers may not actually be interested in given the actual post hoc strategies employed) and that various flexible and well-known statistical alternatives are available, I suggest that researchers consult these better known, robust, and flexible procedures instead, given the proper match with the research question of interest. Just because a researcher has multiple dependent variables of interest does not mean that a MANOVA should be used at all.",25.0,MANOVA: A Procedure Whose Time Has Passed?,2020.0
