"Making evaluation work: One school district's experience   Given the paucity of evaluation studies of gifted programs in the literature, this article shares the experiences of the Greenwich Public Schools in sponsoring an external evaluation of their K - 8 program for gifted and talented youngsters. The article explains the methodology used in the evaluation, discusses findings and recommendations, and describes how the results were translated into program improvement efforts. Also addressed are the evaluators' observations about lessons learned in the process of the evaluation; these lessons reflect on the utility of information gathered.",638.0,Making evaluation work: One school district's experience,1997.0
"Intellectually gifted preschoolers' perceived competence: Relations to maternal attitudes, concerns, and support   The relations of maternal attitudes, concerns, and support networks to intellectually gifted children's perceived competence, as measured by the Pictorial Scale of Perceived Competence and Social Acceptance for Young Children (Harter & Pike, 1984), were examined in a sample of 28 middle-class, Caucasian mothers and their gifted preschool children. Mothers' attitudes toward independence and strictness, their concerns, and support network variables (i.e., perceived helpfulness of the network, willingness to seek help from the network, and the amount of contact the child had with network members) were found to be significantly related to multiple dimensions of children's perceived competence. Implications for theory, research, and practice address understanding gifted children's perceived competence in relation to parental correlates.",639.0,"Intellectually gifted preschoolers' perceived competence: Relations to maternal attitudes, concerns, and support",1997.0
"Developmental changes in mathematically precocious young children: Longitudinal and gender effects   Young children with advanced mathematical skill (N = 276) were followed for two years, during kindergarten through 1st grade or 1st through 2nd grade. Children were randomly assigned to an intervention condition reflecting a constructivist approach or a control condition. Mean scores for the control group on standardized math, verbal, and visual-spatial measures increased or remained the same. Boys gained more than girls on the quantitative and visual-spatial measures. The treatment group made greater gains than the control group on quantitative measures only. Gender did not interact with treatment condition. Correlations among the quantitative, verbal, and visual-spatial factors remained stable for control children, but the correlation between quantitative and verbal factors increased for the intervention group.",640.0,Developmental changes in mathematically precocious young children: Longitudinal and gender effects,1997.0
"Cooperative learning environments: Effects on academic attitudes of gifted students   The attitudes of academically gifted students and the general cohort toward cooperative learning and academic school subjects were studied. Three hypotheses were tested: (a) in classes where cooperative learning is used, nonidentified children will exhibit mole positive attitudes toward cooperative learning methods than their more academically able peers; (b) boys will exhibit more positive attitudes toward cooperative learning than girls; (c) Gifted children, in contrast to non-gifted peers, will exhibit more positive attitudes in settings where cooperative learning is seldom or never used than in settings where such instruction is frequently used. Data obtained from 28 classes of sixth-, seventh-, and eighth-graders in four schools generally supported hypotheses (a) and (b), but not (c). Although not a strong finding, overall attitudes toward school subjects were most positive in classes where cooperative learning was used sparingly as an instructional supplement.",641.0,Cooperative learning environments: Effects on academic attitudes of gifted students,1997.0
"Gifted women and marriage   This study analyzed the perceived relationship between marriage and achievement among 167 able women, ages 45-65, who were alumnae at the University of Michigan. Women who perceived their husbands as supportive believed they had highpotential for achievement, in part, because of the husband's support, the couple's commitment to joint family goals, and willingness to share domestic chores. Women who perceived their husbands occasionally supportive, felt free to achieve occasionally. These women reported that greater levels of achievement were possible if they confronted their husband through negotiation or if they developed talents that contributed to the family's income. Women felt they had low potential for achievement if they had an unsupportive spouse or worked solely for financial gain.",642.0,Gifted women and marriage,1997.0

"Psychological intensities in young gifted children   Emotional sensitivity and emotional intensity are well documented in gifted children, Dabrowski (1967, 1972) proposed that sensitivity and intensity were st part of these children's psychological makeup and instead of being indicators of neurotic imbalances, were positive potentials For further growth. These characteristics were displayed in gifted children through 5 overexcitabilities: psychomotor, sensual, intellectual, imaginational, and emotional. This theory was investigated using a qualitative case study methodology Data were collected on 5 young gifted children (ages 4 through 6) and analyzed using Dabrowski's 5 overexcitabilities as a theoretical framework. Results displayed that the 5 overexcitabilities were manifested in the children through behaviors in the classroom and at home. Results support the use of Dabrowski's theory in identifying and understanding some aspects of the behavior of young gifted children.",646.0,Psychological intensities in young gifted children,1997.0
"Early identification of gifted minority kindergarten students in Newark, NJ   The overall objective of the ''Minority Gifted Children'' project is to promote the cognitive and educational development of kindergarten through second grade economically disadvantaged minority gifted children from Newark, New Jersey. Prior to the inception of this project, no Newark public schools provided gifted services for kindergarten students, and the programs for first and second graders were serving a disproportionately small number of children. The current report presents data on a screening and assessment procedure being developed to identify gifted inner city minority kindergarten students. Before the project began, only 0.2% of children entering first grade were identified as gifted, in contrast to the 2% found in this sample. The method of identification used in this project appears to hold promise as a relatively cost efficient method of finding young minority children who are gifted in cognitive skill areas. This work indicates that young inner city minority gifted children exist. Therefore, it is imperative that education programs be provided to nurture potential excellence and achievement in this population.",647.0,"Early identification of gifted minority kindergarten students in Newark, NJ",1997.0
"The self-concept of gifted adolescents in a congregated program   A positive self-concept is one of the most important forces driving a student to achieve. This study employed a combination of the Harter Self Perception profile for Adolescents (SPPA), used over time, and an interview technique to study 25 gifted adolescents during the transition year in a congregated (grouped) classroom for high-ability students in secondary school. The self-image of the students increased significantly in the subscales of Romantic Appeal and Close Friendship. There was also an interact-ion of time by gender on Behavioral Conduct. Changes in importance ratings also occurred with significant interactions of time by gender on Scholastic Competence, Behavioral Conduct, and Close Friendship. The interviews revealed that gifted students enjoyed being with their gifted peers, however, that they were conscious of being labelled as different. The descriptive study provides insights into the self-concept of students in a congregated (grouped) program.",648.0,The self-concept of gifted adolescents in a congregated program,1997.0
"Childhood traits and conditions of eminent women scientists   The childhood traits and conditions of 21 eminent American women scientists were compared with these of 235 eminent women in other fields. As girls, those who became eminent scientists were much more like, rather than different from, other girls who became eminent. All girls were, for example, precocious and hard working. In early life, however young scientists did exhibit several distinguishing traits from girls who became eminent in other fields. They were more concentrated on science and engaged in scientific activities; they were also more bookish and scholarly Many lived in rural areas and were allowed or encouraged to pursue nature study, reading, and writing. Case studies of two women scientists exemplify early traits and opportunities that distinguish girls who became eminent women scientists.",649.0,Childhood traits and conditions of eminent women scientists,1997.0
"Perennial debates and tacit assumptions in the education of gifted children   For many years, educators of the gifted have debated topics central to the field such as definition, identification, and curriculum (Getzels & Dillon, 1973). This paper explores the possible relationships between gifted educators' periodic debates and the philosophical war among advocates of differing perspectives of social science research. The authors discuss how the acceptance of a particular mode of inquiry embeds tacit ideas into the debate that make resolution difficult. The tacit assumptions of three modes of disciplined inquiry (empirical-analytic, interpretive, and transformative) are presented in conjunction with the accompanying reformulation and reconceptualization of issues (definition, identification, and curriculum) that occur with each mode of inquiry.",650.0,Perennial debates and tacit assumptions in the education of gifted children,1997.0

"Challenging expectations: Case studies of high-potential, culturally diverse young children   For an array of complex reasons, minority students and students from low-income backgrounds are typically underrepresented in programs for learners identified as gifted. Project START, a university/school district collaboration, identified and served high-potential, low-income and/or minority, primary age students based on multiple intelligence theory. Instructional and programmatic interventions also included multicultural emphases, language immersion, use of manipulatives, participation in mentorships, and a family outreach program. This article reports findings from eight case studies of START learners, and provides insights into factors that promoted success and discouraged success for these learners, both in the regular classroom and in transition to special services for gifted learners.",656.0,"Challenging expectations: Case studies of high-potential, culturally diverse young children",1997.0
"An analysis of teacher nominations and student performance in gifted programs   This study evaluated the relationship of teacher nomination instruments to later performance of students in a gifted program. Teacher nominations were based on two instruments, an instrument designed specifically to assess gifted behaviors of students from culturally divergent and/or low income populations and an instrument designed to assess gifted behaviors in the general population. Separate canonical correlation analyses between these two instruments and a gifted teacher rating of student performance resulted in significant findings indicating relationships between the teacher nominations and later school performance. Structure correlations showed nominations based on thinking abilities, general gifted behaviors, and special learning skills were related to later performance on creativity, group skills, and language abilities.",657.0,An analysis of teacher nominations and student performance in gifted programs,1997.0
"Metacognitive knowledge of gifted children and nonidentified children in early elementary school   The study compared the declarative metacognitive knowledge of 22 gifted and 40 general cohort kindergarten and first grade children. Children were given a metacognitive interview questionnaire examining their understanding of variables related to memory and attention. Gifted children were superior to the general cohort for only 18% of the memory and 12% of the attention questions. Collapsing across all the questions, however, the gifted showed significantly higher general metacognitive knowledge. Greater metacognitive knowledge in gifted children emerges by early elementary school, particularly for metacognitive attributions.",658.0,Metacognitive knowledge of gifted children and nonidentified children in early elementary school,1997.0
"Expanding Lazarus and Folkman's paradigm to the social and emotional adjustment of gifted children and adolescents (SEAM)   A qualitative study of how 20 gifted children and adolescents cope with demands and pressures they experience is the basis of the model of social and emotional adjustment presented in this article. The model combines patterns in the ways the children and adolescents responded to the stressors in their lives with theoretical and empirical information from the fields of child development and personal adjustment to stress. Intrapersonal, family, school, and peer influences, as well as functional and dysfunctional patterns of social and emotional adjustment, are explained within the framework of the model.",659.0,Expanding Lazarus and Folkman's paradigm to the social and emotional adjustment of gifted children and adolescents (SEAM),1997.0
"Intellectual contributions and mutual support among developmentally advanced children in homogeneous and heterogeneous work/discussion groups   To investigate previous claims that close association among gifted children provides them with the intellectual stimulation and socioaffective support they need, 32 eighth grade students (18 males and 14 females), divided according to their educational program placement, were observed working on various tasks in either homogeneous or heterogeneous ability groups. Homogeneously congregated gifted children in a self-contained program exchanged constructive types of knowledge and prosocial feedback significantly more frequently than either homogeneously grouped nonidentified students or heterogeneously mixed gifted and nonidentified youth. Gifted children within the mixed group tended to congregate among themselves; they varied widely in the frequency and nature of their interactions with nonidentified group mates.",660.0,Intellectual contributions and mutual support among developmentally advanced children in homogeneous and heterogeneous work/discussion groups,1997.0

"Rethinking multipotentiality among the intellectually gifted: A critical review and recommendations   This paper critically reviews the concept of multipotentiality as it has been defined and encountered in the scientific literature on gifted children. Until recently, it has bot been adequately subjected to empirical evaluation. Despite its ubiquitous presence in the literature, several pieces of evidence are presented suggesting that multipotentiality has been erroneously interpreted and falsely assumed to apply to a majority of intellecutually gifted individuals. Findings are summarized from a recent report (Achter, Lunbinski, & Benbow, 1996) on the ability interest, and value profiles of over 1000 students from the Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth (SMPY), as well as evidence compiled from other empirical studies, indicating that above-level assessment of abilities and preferences among gifted adolescents reveal markedly differentiated profiles for the vast majority (over 95% when all factors were consulted). Thus, the concept of multipotentiality requires rethinking. Traditional assessment tools found in vocational psychology (i.e., questionnaires. and tests measuring abilities, interests, and values), when offered in an above-level format, are useful in serving the educational and career counseling needs of intellectually gifted young adolescents. Further, such tools are helpful for gaining an appreciation of the diversity of individual differences among the intellectually talented.",662.0,Rethinking multipotentiality among the intellectually gifted: A critical review and recommendations,1997.0
"Specialized counseling services for gifted youth and their families: A needs assessment   Although many authors have recommended counseling for the gifted (Colangelo, 1991; Kerr; 1986; Silverman, 1993b), little research has been done to find out what types of counseling services parents, teachers, and counseling professionals believe to be most beneficial to the development of gifted and talented individuals (Myers & Pace, 1986; Passow 1991; Shore, Cornell, Robinson, & Ward, 1991). In this study 335 patients, school personnel, and related counseling professionals were surveyed to determine their perceptions of the specialized counseling needs of gifted children and adolescents as part of a needs assessment for a proposed university-based counseling center. Results indicated that all groups of respondents believed that gifted and talented youth have important social, emotional, family, and talent and career development needs that can best be met by differentiated counseling services; and that such services are not readily available to gifted youth. Implications of the study for the development of counseling services and the training of counseling professionals are discussed.",663.0,Specialized counseling services for gifted youth and their families: A needs assessment,1997.0
"Differences in EEG alpha activity between gifted and non-identified individuals: Insights into problem solving   The study investigated differences in electroencephalography (EEG) alpha activity between gifted and non-identified students. Seventeen gifted and 17 non-identified students. participated in the experiment. Their EEG was recorded while they solved four problems. Two measures were used: 1) an asymmetry index or differences in hemispheric activity and 2) the overall difference between a relaxed mental state and problem solving. The findings can be summarized as follows: First, gifted students in a relaxed mental condition showed greater left hemispheric activation than did non-identified students. In contrast, during problem,solving, non-identified students showed greater left hemispheric activity than did gifted students. Second, gifted students exhibited a higher overall hemispheric activation in a relaxed mental state and exploring the problem, and a lower activation when problem solving was involved, than did non-identified students.",664.0,Differences in EEG alpha activity between gifted and non-identified individuals: Insights into problem solving,1997.0
"I don't want to sit in the corner cutting out valentines: Leadership roles for teachers of talented art students   Two research studies which focus on the process and results of educating teachers of high ability visual arts students to take leadership roles in their schools communities, and beyond are presented. One study involved focus groups of 1994 participants in the Artistically Talented Program (ATP) at Indiana University; the other included a survey sent to all teachers who participated in ATP from 1991 to 1995. A framework based on a content analysis of the data in these two studies has applicability to other inservice education programs for teachers of talented art students. Knowledge of subject matter content, pedagogy, building self-esteem, and allowing choices can lead teachers of artistically talented students, who have leadership potential, to collaborate with others. Teachers can become empowered to make changes in their private and professional lives that eventually result in communities of caring professionals able to assume leadership roles.",665.0,I don't want to sit in the corner cutting out valentines: Leadership roles for teachers of talented art students,1997.0
"A multi-site case study of successful classroom practices for high ability students   A multi-site case study was conducted to describe 10 elementary schools and classrooms with a reputation for implementing differentiated practices to meet the needs of high ability students. The researchers found that classroom teachers at some sites employed flexible grouping practices or provided opportunities for advanced level projects to accommodate students' differing academic needs. At other sites, teachers collaborated with other teachers at their grade level or with district curriculum specialists to provide more academic challenge for talented students. And in some situations, the leadership of school principals or superintendents appeared to have a strong impact on teachers' instructional practices. The themes that emerged across the sites include: (a) teachers' advanced knowledge and training, (b) teachers' willingness and readiness to embrace change, (c) collaboration, (d) teachers' beliefs and strategies for differentiating the curriculum, (e) leadership, and (f) autonomy and support.",666.0,A multi-site case study of successful classroom practices for high ability students,1997.0
