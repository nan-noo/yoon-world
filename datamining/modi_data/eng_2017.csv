"Measuring Creative Capacity in Gifted Students: Comparing Teacher Ratings and Student Products creativity; elementary; rubric; teacher rating; gifted; gender differences Creativity and giftedness are frequently associated, and schools may use measures of creativity for identifying gifted and talented students. The researchers examined three aspects of elementary student creativity: (a) the relationship between a teacher's rating of student creativity and rubric-scored student writing samples, (b) group differences regarding creativity between identified gifted and general education students, and (c) potential gender differences evident in teacher ratings of creativity as well as creative products. Participants in the study were 155 Grade 4 students in an urban district in a southwestern state. Teacher ratings on three different scales were related to student creative products, yielding Pearson correlations ranging from r = .20 to r = .27. Identified gifted students scored higher than general education students in both teacher ratings of creativity (d = 0.83) and written products (d = 0.53). Female students scored higher than male students in both teacher ratings of creativity (d = 0.22) and written products (d = 0.57). These findings suggest that teacher ratings moderately predict creative student products. Identified gifted students scored consistently higher than general education students in creativity, and females scored slightly higher than males on creativity measures.",70.0,Measuring Creative Capacity in Gifted Students: Comparing Teacher Ratings and Student Products,2017.0
"An Alternate Path: The Experience of High-Potential Individuals Who Left School dropout; gifted; secondary; interpretative phenomenological analysis Dropping out of school represents the culmination of a process that begins long before a student enters high school. It is estimated that a quarter of students with high potential leave school without a high school diploma; however, research on how high-potential students uniquely experience dropping out of school is in its beginning stages. This study sought to acquire a rich understanding of how 14 gifted individuals who did not complete high school interpreted this experience and the meaning they attributed to it. Six major themes emerged from the data: (a) significant external circumstances, (b) need for support, (c) social influences, (d) outlets, (e) an alternate path, and (f) reflecting on the path. This exploratory study enhances our understanding of why gifted students choose to leave school and supports the validity of alternate paths to success.",71.0,An Alternate Path: The Experience of High-Potential Individuals Who Left School,2017.0
"Online Teacher Professional Development for Gifted Education: Examining the Impact of a New Pedagogical Model online teacher professional development; model; gifted education This article theoretically develops and examines the outcomes of a pilot study that evaluates the PACKaGE Model of online Teacher Professional Development (the Model). The Model was created to facilitate positive pedagogical change within gifted education teachers' practice, attitude, collaboration, content knowledge, and goal effectiveness. Kirkpatrick and Kirkpatrick's model of training evaluation suggests that trainees should evaluate the training for satisfaction at the time the training is completed, as well as 6 months after, to evaluate for behavior change. Applying Kirkpatrick and Kirkpatrick's model, findings indicate that teachers were immediately satisfied with the Model's effectiveness, adequacy, and overall quality. Six months after the online teacher professional development, teachers indicated a strong positive change in each of the five gifted education pedagogical components. Overall, these preliminary findings suggest that the use of the Model creates a positive change within teachers' gifted education pedagogy.",72.0,Online Teacher Professional Development for Gifted Education: Examining the Impact of a New Pedagogical Model,2017.0
"Exploring the Spatial Ability of Undergraduate Students: Association With Gender, STEM Majors, and Gifted Program Membership spatial ability; mental rotation; gender differences; gifted students; STEM; path analysis Spatial ability has been valued as a talent domain and as an assessment form that reduces cultural, linguistic, and socioeconomic status biases, yet little is known of the spatial ability of students in gifted programs compared with those in general education. Spatial ability is considered an important indicator of potential talent in the domains of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). This study explored undergraduate students' spatial ability, focusing on mental rotation, by investigating the relationships of three variables with performance on a spatial ability test, in terms of test scores and test completion time. A three-way analysis of variance revealed statistically significant main effects of gifted program participation, choice of academic major, and gender, suggesting that students who participated in a gifted program, who majored in a STEM discipline, or who were male outperformed their counterparts on a measure of spatial ability when the other conditions were equivalent. No interaction effects existed among the three variables, indicating that none of them functioned as a moderator of students' performance on the spatial ability assessment. However, when spatial ability was considered as a mediating variable in a path model, gender had the largest total effect on the probability of students majoring in a STEM area. In addition, the more time students spent on the spatial ability test, the better they tended to perform, which is a finding inconsistent with current literature.",73.0,"Exploring the Spatial Ability of Undergraduate Students: Association With Gender, STEM Majors, and Gifted Program Membership",2017.0
"High-Ability Students' Perspectives on an Affective Curriculum in a Diverse, University-Based Summer Residential Enrichment Program affective intervention; social and emotional development; underserved populations; Native Americans; American Indiana; gifted adolescents; gifted students; out-of-school programming; affective curriculum The purpose of this study was to investigate how high-ability students experienced their participation in an affective curriculum through small-group discussions in a diverse, university-based, summer enrichment program for talented youth. The investigation included two closely related studies. The first study included 77 high-ability students from several cultures and economic backgrounds who participated in the 2014 summer program. The second was a retrospective study with 24 Native American students from Dine, Ojibwe, and Lakota tribes who had participated in the affective curriculum in 2013 to determine if their participation had any longer term effects on this subgroup. In general, the students from all backgrounds in both studies said the small-group discussions enriched their overall program experience. Twenty-two of the 24 Native American students from the three tribes who participated in the retrospective study reported that they believed they had changed their behaviors during the past year because of their participation in the small-group discussions the previous summer. The changes mentioned most by these students were exhibiting stronger self-confidence and being more open to people. The results of this study suggests that the affective intervention was regarded positively. It provided both short- and long-term benefits to the high-ability students who participated in the program.",74.0,"High-Ability Students' Perspectives on an Affective Curriculum in a Diverse, University-Based Summer Residential Enrichment Program",2017.0
"Paradigm Shifts in Gifted Education: An Examination Vis-a-Vis Its Historical Situatedness and Pedagogical Sensibilities gifted education; identification; inclusion; development; paradigm; narrative review; history After nearly a century of development, gifted education has evolved into a complex educational discipline with well thought out pedagogy and research agendas. However, while the number of studies escalates, the field as a whole has been criticized for producing fragmented and piecemeal results. One of the reasons for these shortfalls is that the field has invested little in meta-theoretical aspects, such as historical perspectives and philosophical foundations. This article is a comprehensive review and analysis of the conceptual changes and paradigm shifts in gifted education. Three major paradigm shifts in gifted education were identifieddemystification (i.e., giftedness as manifested wonders), identification (i.e., giftedness as measurable predictions), and transaction (i.e., effectuation of human possibilities). Presently, there is still an implicit focus on the identification paradigm despite considerable efforts to shift the focus to creating and sustaining appropriate developmental niches for all individuals. Debates in the field are highlighted to provoke discussion of future directions.",75.0,Paradigm Shifts in Gifted Education: An Examination Vis-a-Vis Its Historical Situatedness and Pedagogical Sensibilities,2017.0

"The 15-Minute Audition: Translating a Proof of Concept Into a Domain-Specific Screening Device for Mathematical Talent philosophical; theoretical; definition and; or conception of giftedness; talent; talent development In 2011, Subotnik, Olszewski-Kubilius, and Worrell proposed a conceptual model for talent development applicable to all domains. Although grounded in available psychological research, significant questions remain regarding practical applications of each tenet of the model. In this article, we highlight a method of implementing the model's focus on domain-specific abilities. Mathematics was selected as a domain with sufficient literature and importance to serve as the first in a series of proposed explorations into identifying domain-specific abilities. The methodology adapts an identification procedurethat is, auditioncommonly used in performance domains (e.g., dance) to determine drop-dead abilities needed for successful talent developmentin this case, mathematics. Identifying abilities central to potential creative talent in a domain may allow us to move away from relying solely on standardized measures of general ability and academic achievement, especially for the early identification of talent.",77.0,The 15-Minute Audition: Translating a Proof of Concept Into a Domain-Specific Screening Device for Mathematical Talent,2017.0
"Envisioning a New Foundation for Gifted Education: Evolving Complexity Theory (ECT) of Talent Development characteristic versus maximal adaptation; evolving complexity; biology versus culture; talent development; developmental stages and transitions This article presents a new theory of talent development, evolving complexity theory (ECT), in the context of the changing theoretical directions as well as the landscape of gifted education. I argue that gifted education needs a new foundation that provides a broad psychosocial basis than what the notion of giftedness can afford. A focus on talent development rather than giftedness should be based on a theory of talent development that is truly developmental, treating the developing person as an open, dynamic, and adaptive system, changing oneself adaptively while interacting with environmental opportunities and challenges. To introduce ECT, I first delineate the meaning and significance of four dimensions or parameters of talent development undergirding this new theory: domain, person, development, and culture. I then describe how ECT explicates the developmental processes and transitions as the result of human adaptations to environmental opportunities and challenges. More specifically, ECT uses the constructs of characteristic and maximal adaptation to elucidate how domain, person, development, and culture jointly shape a particular line of talent development, and how cognitive, affective, and social processes interact to push and sustain a critical transition from characteristic adaptation to maximal adaptation, eventually leading to high-caliber performance and creative productivity. I finally discuss the theoretical contributions and practical utilities of ECT for future research and practice.",78.0,Envisioning a New Foundation for Gifted Education: Evolving Complexity Theory (ECT) of Talent Development,2017.0
"Systemic Gifted Education: A Theoretical Introduction systemic gifted education; actiotope; educational capital; learning capital Over the past few decades, systemic thinking has gained in popularity in developmental and learning sciences. The trend has, however, shown up in gifted education research only occasionally. The aim of this article is to introduce systemic thinking to the field of giftedness and explore possibilities for its application. In the first part, a definition of a system is provided and basic concepts of systemic thinking are introduced. In the second part, a full-fledged systemic model is introduced, the actiotope model of giftedness. In the third part, implications for gifted education are elaborated. In the discussion, the authors explain (a) how systemic thinking can make a valuable contribution to gifted education, (b) why systemic thinking will complement rather than replace current approaches to gifted education, and (c) the necessity of combining systemic thinking with other empirically testable theories.",79.0,Systemic Gifted Education: A Theoretical Introduction,2017.0
"The Network Concept of Creativity and Deep Thinking: Applications to Social Opinion Formation and Talent Support creativity; charisma; deep thinking; deliberative democracy; gifted education; social networks Our century has unprecedented new challenges, which need creative solutions and deep thinking. Contemplative, deep thinking became an endangered species in our rushing world of Tweets, elevator pitches, and fast decisions. Here, we describe how important aspects of both creativity and deep thinking can be understood as network phenomena of conceptual and social networks. Creative nodes occupy highly dynamic, boundary spanning positions in social networks. Creative thinking requires alternating plasticity-dominated and rigidity-dominated mind-sets, which can be helped by dynamically changing social network structures. In the closing section, we present three case studies which demonstrate the applications of the concept in the Hungarian research student movement, the Hungarian Templeton Program, and the Youth Platform of the European Talent Support Network. These examples show how talent support programs can mobilize the power of social networks to enhance creative, deliberative, deep thinking of talented young minds, influencing social opinion, leading to community action, and developing charismatic leadership skills.",80.0,The Network Concept of Creativity and Deep Thinking: Applications to Social Opinion Formation and Talent Support,2017.0

We do so by describing and discussing Project Excite, a working example that demonstrates such a model in the context of gifted education. We first trace the history, the impetus, and key design elements of Project Excite, a front-loading intervention aiming to develop the potential of underrepresented students for advanced science, technology, engineering, and mathematics learning from early grades. We review a line of past research and key findings on Project Excite over its 14-year journey. We then discuss the implication of Project Excite for gifted programming in gifted education.

However, without changes and implementation of these policies, systematic change is unlikely to occur. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to argue that policy research should be a top priority. To begin, we define and contrast three terms common in crafting policypolicy, advocacy, and intervention. Next, we provide a context of previous policy research in gifted education. We then detail areas in which policy research is the most critical.

However, the actual degree of cognitive diversity has yet to be considered regarding instructional implications for advanced learners. We used four data sets (three state-level and one national) from diverse contexts to evaluate how many students perform above grade level in English Language Arts and mathematics. Results revealed that among American elementary and middle school students, 20% to 49% in English Language Arts and 14% to 37% in mathematics scored 1 year or more above grade level.

"Online Mentoring as an Extracurricular Measure to Encourage Talented Girls in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics): An Empirical Study of One-on-One Versus Group Mentoring mentoring; gifted girls; STEM; network analysis; gifted education; online gifted education Online mentoring provides an effective means of extracurricular gifted education for talented girls in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Comparative studies on the effectiveness of one-on-one versus group mentoring are lacking, however. The authors investigated this question in the context of a Germany-wide online mentoring program that employed both approaches. Study participants were girls enrolled in high-achiever-track secondary education in Germany (N = 347) who were mentored online by female academics in STEM for 6 months, in either one-on-one (N = 156) or group mentoring (N = 191). It was assumed that the specific many-to-many group-mentoring condition examined in our study would be more effective than the one-on-one mentoring condition with respect to (a) the proportion of STEM communication and (b) the extent of STEM-related networking, both of which are important predictors of successful mentoring. Furthermore, the authors (c) expected more growth in elective intentions for the group-mentoring participants and (d) assumed that participants' centrality in their respective STEM networks would predict this increase. The study presents empirical support for all four assumptions and thus suggests that the special form of group mentoring examined here may be a more successful measure of extracurricular gifted education for girls in STEM than one-on-one mentoring.",85.0,"Online Mentoring as an Extracurricular Measure to Encourage Talented Girls in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics): An Empirical Study of One-on-One Versus Group Mentoring",2017.0

Using district classifications assigned by the National Center for Education Statistics and Texas school district data (n = 1,029) from the Academic Excellence Indicator System, the role of school district classification on gifted education outcomes was investigated. Contextual variables such as school demographics and school size were also examined. The study focused on rural and town school districts which are further classified as fringe, distant, or remote (level of proximity) within those two broad categories. Results of one-way multivariate analysis of variance indicated an effect of proximity for both rural and town districts on both contextual variables and gifted education outcomes. Additionally, rural fringe districts were found to be more similar to districts not classified as rural (i.e., urban, suburban, town) than to rural distant and rural remote districts.

In addition, we investigated the extent to which teachers' beliefs about students' academic, motivational, and social development after grade skipping may explain teachers' acceptance of this accelerative strategy. Moreover, we examined whether teachers' acceptance is linked to their decisions about using this intervention. Using data from the PARS project, which included 316 teachers from 18 secondary schools in the German federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia, we assessed teachers' acceptance, beliefs, and perceived knowledge about grade skipping using 4-point rating scales. Teachers also reported whether they had advised a student to skip a grade. Multilevel regression analyses indicated that teachers' beliefs about students' social, motivational, and academic development largely explained their acceptance. Teachers who showed a higher level of acceptance and perceived knowledge were more likely to have recommended grade skipping before.
