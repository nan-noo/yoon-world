"Predictors of Attitudes to Gifted Programs/Provisions: Evidence From Preservice Educators giftedness; attitudes; gifted programs; gifted provisions; cultural orientation; power distance; elitism This study investigated whether a number of cultural orientation, sociodemographic, academic achievement, and personal/personal experience variables predict attitudes toward the provision of special programs/provisions for gifted students. Surveys completed by 241 Australian preservice teachers were analyzed using confirmatory factor analyses and multiple regression analyses. The findings suggest that (a) low power distance orientation, contact with gifted persons, and older age predict support for special gifted programs/provisions and (b) the lack of prior experience of an advanced/extended curriculum in a regular classroom and younger age predict the perception that special gifted programs/provisions are elitist.",141.0,Predictors of Attitudes to Gifted Programs/Provisions: Evidence From Preservice Educators,2014.0
"Social Understanding of High-Ability Children in Middle and Late Childhood high-ability children; theory of mind; perception accuracy; cognitive ability; peer acceptance Despite its importance in social development, social understanding has hardly been studied in high-ability children. This study explores differences in social understanding between children in high-ability and regular classrooms, specifically theory of mind (ToM) and perception accuracy, as well as associations between individual characteristics (age, gender, peer acceptance, and cognitive ability) and social understanding. Participants were 671 children in Grades 1 to 6 (55% boys; M age 9.20 years). Children in high-ability classrooms had higher ToM scores in Grades 1 to 3 and were more accurate perceivers of acceptance than children in regular classrooms. No group differences were found for ToM in Grades 4 to 6. ToM was associated with several individual characteristics, in particular age and cognitive ability. Perception accuracy was mainly related to peer acceptance. Suggestions for future research and implications for practitioners are discussed.",142.0,Social Understanding of High-Ability Children in Middle and Late Childhood,2014.0
"Evaluating the Efficacy of Using Predifferentiated and Enriched Mathematics Curricula for Grade 3 Students: A Multisite Cluster-Randomized Trial mathematics; differentiated curricula; enriched curricula; Grade 3 students; multilevel model; cluster randomized trial Despite the potential of differentiated curricula to enhance learning, limited research exists that documents their impact on Grade 3 students of all ability levels. To determine if there was a difference in achievement between students involved in 16 weeks of predifferentiated, enriched mathematics curricula and students using their district's curricula, we conducted a multisite cluster-randomized control trial with 43 schools in 12 states. A series of three-level models, using pre- and postachievement test data, failed to show a main effect for treatment, but the results suggested a treatment by achievement-level interaction that was moderated by the achievement level of the school. As a result, the highest achieving students in the lower achieving schools seemed to receive the greatest benefit from the treatment curricula. An analysis of researcher-developed unit tests revealed that treatment students successfully learned and applied the curricula's challenging mathematics. Thus, using the predifferentiated and enriched mathematics curricula with heterogeneous ability students appeared to do no harm-students who completed the treatment curricula did as well as their control counterparts, on average. Evidence of its achievement-related benefits is more ambiguous; however, the findings do suggest some benefits for the highest achieving students in lower achieving schools.",143.0,Evaluating the Efficacy of Using Predifferentiated and Enriched Mathematics Curricula for Grade 3 Students: A Multisite Cluster-Randomized Trial,2014.0
"Implementing Enrichment Clusters in Elementary Schools: Lessons Learned Schoolwide Enrichment Model; enrichment clusters; Renzulli; authentic learning Enrichment clusters offer a way for schools to encourage a high level of learning as students and adults work together to develop a product, service, or performance by applying advanced knowledge and authentic processes to real-world problems. This study utilized a qualitative research design to examine the perceptions and experiences of two enrichment specialists who led the implementation of enrichment clusters in their schools. The perceptions of the participants hold particular value, as the success of clusters depends heavily on the ability of the specialist to effectively plan and organize clusters so that they meet the needs of administrators, teachers, students, and parents. Findings indicated that the participants felt that clusters were worthwhile, despite the time and effort required for implementation. A number of factors were considered critical for the success of clusters, including time and money, teachers as facilitators, focusing on student interests, and planning for rules, routines, and procedures. In addition, the participants identified several ways in which clusters were adapted in order to meet the needs of the school. The study indicates implications, and limitations of these findings are also discussed.",144.0,Implementing Enrichment Clusters in Elementary Schools: Lessons Learned,2014.0

Results indicated that volunteer experiences, which encourage students' selection of and active involvement with community-based projects, may positively affect Physical/Mental Energy. Also, allowing students face-to-face time with dissimilar volunteer recipients may positively affect Sensitivity to Others. Implications for educators and researchers are discussed.",145.0,"The Impact of Direct Involvement I and Direct Involvement II Experiences on Secondary School Students' Social Capital, as Measured by Co-Cognitive Factors of the Operation Houndstooth Intervention Theory",2014.0
"Through a Different Lens: Reflecting on a Strengths-Based, Talent-Focused Approach for Twice-Exceptional Learners twice-exceptional; middle school age; high school age; social and/or emotional development and adjustment This study sought to understand the experiences of a cohort of students who entered a strengths-based private school for twice-exceptional students during middle school and successfully completed graduation requirements. Using a case study design, the researchers analyzed data collected from student and teacher interviews, parent focus groups, educational records, and psychological reports. Findings indicate areas of change and development across cognitive, emotional/behavioral, and social domains and identified five factors underlying student growth: psychological safety, tolerance for asynchrony, time, positive relationships, and the consistent use of a strengths-based, talent-focused philosophy. Data also revealed four benefits from the talent development opportunities offered by the school. Participating in talent development activities enabled students to become part of a social group; to overcome some social, emotional, and cognitive challenges in context; to develop ongoing mentor and professional relationships with people in talent areas; and to develop expertise in an area of talent. This research supports the incorporation of a strengths-based, talent-focused approach for twice-exceptional learners.",146.0,"Through a Different Lens: Reflecting on a Strengths-Based, Talent-Focused Approach for Twice-Exceptional Learners",2014.0

"The Validity of the Achievement-Orientation Model for Gifted Middle School Students: An Exploratory Study structural equation modeling; underachievers; middle school; student motivation Gifted underachievement represents a frustrating loss of potential for society. Although attempts have been made to develop interventions to reverse gifted underachievement, the theoretical underpinnings of these interventions have yet to be empirically validated. The purpose of this study was to investigate the validity of the Achievement-Orientation Model for gifted middle school students. Based on a sample of 156 gifted sixth- and seventh-grade mathematics students, results of the current study suggest two unique clusters of gifted students, those whose attitudes toward each of the model's constructs are positive and those who attitudes are not as positive. Furthermore, results of a path analysis demonstrate that most of the relationships posited by the model do appear to exist. The findings of this study suggest that the Achievement-Orientation Model may hold promise for the development of interventions to address gifted underachievement.",149.0,The Validity of the Achievement-Orientation Model for Gifted Middle School Students: An Exploratory Study,2014.0

"Alternative Pathways to Talent Development in Music: The Narrative of an Eminent Filipino Singer-Songwriter case study; musical talent development; alternative pathways; motivation The narrative of an eminent Filipino singer-songwriter, Noel Cabangon, provides a description of an alternative pathway to musical talent development. Most theories on talent development assume that a young artist would have access to the resources required for one to advance in the domain. The results of multiple in-depth interviews suggested that in the absence of such resources, there is an alternative pathway toward expertise in the musical domain. This pathway involves early exposure to music in the context of daily living, the active role played by the neighborhood and the entire community in nurturing the musical talent, and deliberate practice. The article also explores various motivations (both intrinsic and extrinsic) in developing musical expertise. The implications of the research findings to educators and practitioners are also discussed.",151.0,Alternative Pathways to Talent Development in Music: The Narrative of an Eminent Filipino Singer-Songwriter,2014.0
"The Relationship of Cognitive and Executive Functioning With Achievement in Gifted Kindergarten Children gifted identification; gifted assessment; young gifted This study provides baseline data to assist researchers in conducting future studies exploring the developmental trajectories of young gifted learners on measures of cognitive ability and achievement. The study includes common neuropsychological tests associated with preliteracy and the early-reading process as well as markers for inattention and executive functioning skills. Using a sample of kindergarteners identified as gifted, the results indicated that despite intelligence quotient scores in the very superior range and high means on traditional achievement measures, great variability was observed within the sample on several benchmarking measures of cognitive, academic, neuropsychological, and executive functioning. Additionally, only an average mean score on a visual-motor processing neuropsychological measure was obtained. Four neuropsychological measures provided important loadings in canonical correlations with achievement: Oromotor Sequences, Repetition of Nonsense Words, Beery-Buktenica Developmental Test of Visual-Motor Integration scores, and Speeded Naming. In addition to providing baseline data on these measures, the results also offer support for defining giftedness as a developmental process.",152.0,The Relationship of Cognitive and Executive Functioning With Achievement in Gifted Kindergarten Children,2014.0
"Family Environment and Social Development in Gifted Students family environment; gifted students; social competence; peer relationships; parenting Involving more than 1,500 academically gifted students and their parents, this study examined relationships between family environment and social competence of gifted students. Results from an online survey revealed that our gifted students rated their families as cohesive and flexible with high levels of satisfaction and communication among family members. Compared with students, parents identified their families as more intimate, cohesive, and flexible and felt more positively about communication among their family members. Students' ratings of their family were found to be good predictors of their interpersonal ability and peer relationships, and positive correlations were found between the students' social competence and their ratings of functional aspects of the family. Differences were also found by students' level of social competence, with students with higher levels of social competence rating their families more positively. Unlike the norming sample, rigidity was not endorsed as a negative family variable. The results of this study are consistent with previous research in that affectionate, supportive, and respectful family environments appear to be important to the development of interpersonal skills and competency and peer relationships for gifted individuals.",153.0,Family Environment and Social Development in Gifted Students,2014.0

Literature-based assumptions surrounding Native American students' talent development, culture and traditions, cognitive styles and learning preferences, and communication were generated and then reviewed by educators and tribal members for relevance and accurace. This article has three purposes. The first is to analyze the literature-based assumptions concerning gifted education in three Native American communities-Dine, Lakota, and Ojibwe. The second is to call on gifted education researchers to include Native American students in their research. The third is to suggest a research agenda based on data gathered within these communities",155.0,"Gifted Native American Students Literature, Lessons, and Future Directions",2014.0
"Critical Thinking Skills Among Elementary School Students Comparing Identified Gifted and General Education Student Performance differentiation; thinking skills; programming/service delivery models; critical thinking; cognition; learning Education reform efforts, including the current adoption of Common Core State Standards, have increased attention to teaching critical thinking skills to all students. This study investigated the critical thinking skills of fourth-grade students from a school district in Texas, including 45 identified gifted students and 163 general education students. Identified gifted students outperformed general education students on both the Cornell Critical Thinking Test and the Test of Critical Thinking (d = 1.52 and d = 1.36, respectively). There was no evidence of main effects or interaction effects for gender in measures of critical thinking within these samples. Critical thinking scores of students in the three schools did not differ significantly, nor were differences in scores associated with length of exposure to the gifted education program. The association of higher ability with advanced critical thinking skills, but at the same time, the lack of evidence of an effect of the gifted education programs (which did not focus specifically on critical thinking skills) suggests that differentiation of curriculum and instruction for gifted or advanced learners might fruitfully include deliberate differentiation of instruction in this area.",156.0,Critical Thinking Skills Among Elementary School Students Comparing Identified Gifted and General Education Student Performance,2014.0
"Too Smart to Fail Perceptions of Asian American Students' Experiences in a Collegiate Honors Program high-achieving; honors program; Asian American; gifted There is a considerable history of misunderstandings associated with Asian American in education. Although many educators and scholars have begun to pay more attention to unique issues associated with this population, studies exploring these students' experiences as honors students in collegiate contexts are scant in the educational literature. The purpose of this study is to explore high-achieving Asian American students' perceptions of their experiences in a collegiate honors program. Using an ecological framework, the authors explored four Asian American students' unique experiences as members of a collegiate honors program at a large university in the Midwest. Using consensual qualitative research as a methodological framework, six domains were found: (a) experiences in the honors program, (b) resources, (c) perceptions of ethnic identity, (d) career aspirations, (e) suggestions for gifted students, and (f) needs and hopes.",157.0,Too Smart to Fail Perceptions of Asian American Students' Experiences in a Collegiate Honors Program,2014.0
"Gifted Conversations Discursive Patterns in Gifted Classes discourse analysis; initiation-response-evaluation (IRE); dialogic discourse; classroom discourse; gifted education Despite the attested association between giftedness and high verbal abilities, and despite the central role attributed to classroom discourse analysis in educational research, discourse in gifted classes has not received due scholarly attention. This study takes a first step toward filling this gap. This study offers a microanalysis of a corpus of recorded and transcribed interactions from classes of gifted students in the Commonwealth of Virginia. This study focuses on student initiations and on the ways teachers handle these initiations. It is argued that the preponderance of student initiations in the classes observed sets a fertile ground for dialogic discourse to develop. However, student initiations do not guarantee the emergence of dialogic discourse, since teachers sometimes employ instructional practices that hinder its emergence.",158.0,Gifted Conversations Discursive Patterns in Gifted Classes,2014.0
"A Model of Academic Self-Concept Perceived Difficulty and Social Comparison Among Academically Accelerated Secondary School Students gifted high school students; structural equation modeling; acceleration; academic achievement; academic self-concept; goal orientation theory; motivation; big-fish-little-pond effect Academic self-concept predicts students' future goals and is affected by a student's relative success compared with his or her peer group. This exploratory study used structural equation modeling to examine the contributions of the perceived level of difficulty of the curriculum, in addition to the contributions of social comparison and achievement in schoolwork, to academic self-concept among students enrolled in advanced coursework. Along with school achievement, perceived difficulty and social comparison also predicted academic self-concept. The final model indicated that students differentiate between learner self-concept, which is how students perceived their ability to understand new ideas or knowledge, and student self-concept, which is how they perceived their abilities to succeed in school-related tasks. Of these two constructs, student self-concept was a better predictor of future goals; however, the overall effect was small.",159.0,A Model of Academic Self-Concept Perceived Difficulty and Social Comparison Among Academically Accelerated Secondary School Students,2014.0
"Using Above-Level Testing to Track Growth in Academic Achievement in Gifted Students gifted education; above-level testing; reliability; student learning growth rate Above-level testing is the practice of administering aptitude or academic achievement tests that are designed for typical students in higher grades or older age-groups to gifted or high-achieving students. Although widely accepted in gifted education, above-level testing has not been subject to careful psychometric scrutiny. In this study, I examine reliability data, growth trajectories, distributions, and group differences of above-level test scores obtained from the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills and Iowa Tests of Educational Development. Two hundred twenty-four middle school students participated in this study. All participants were tested at least 1 time for an overall total of 435 times. Longitudinal analyses was performed with hierarchical linear modeling and indicated that substantial differences exist between students from overrepresented ethnicities (White and Asian Americans) and those from underrepresented ethnicities (Hispanic and African Americans) in both initial scores and the rate of score gains. Sex differences existed only for the rate of score increases for above-level reading scores. Socioeconomic differences existed but did not have a unique impact beyond that of the ethnicity variable. A discussion of these results within a wider gifted education context and suggestions for further research are included.",160.0,Using Above-Level Testing to Track Growth in Academic Achievement in Gifted Students,2014.0
"Recognizing Academic Potential in Students of Color: Findings of U-STARS similar to PLUS academic potential; children of color; teacher perceptions; barriers to recognition Students of color are often underrepresented in academic programs for gifted and talented students. This study explored the impact of The Teacher's Observation of Potential in Students (TOPS) tool on teachers' ability to systematically observe and document the academic strengths of 5- to 9-year-old students across nine domains. Teachers indicated that without the TOPS, they would have overlooked the academic potential of 22% (1,741) of their children of color and 53% of African American boys, in particular. After using the TOPS, a majority of the teachers (74%) felt they could more readily recognize high-potential students from culturally or linguistically different and economically disadvantaged families. Barriers that might have kept teachers from seeing students' strengths were also examined. Results indicate two statistically significant relationships between teacher race and perceptions of student behavior. This study has implications for supporting teachers' more effective identification of strengths in all children.",161.0,Recognizing Academic Potential in Students of Color: Findings of U-STARS similar to PLUS,2014.0
"Honors Students' Perceptions of Their High School Experiences: The Influence of Teachers on Student Motivation qualitative methodologies; curriculum; high school; motivation; academic achievement; teacher characteristics; gifted and talented; university honors; differentiation Academic motivation is important for students' task persistence, academic performance, and college selection. The goal of this qualitative study was to understand academic motivation from the students' perspective. Focus group discussions with 28 university honors freshman revealed that students most often attributed their interest and motivation in high school to their interactions with their teachers. These findings supported the theoretical foundations of the Achievement Orientation Model and demonstrated how effective teachers can influence all components of that model as they encourage students' growth and satisfaction (building self-efficacy), as they make the content meaningful and challenging for their students (creating task valuation), and as they shape students' perception of support in their environment through building positive relationships and being knowledgeable about the content (fostering a positive environmental perception). Teachers with extensive depth and breadth of content knowledge are better able to foster student motivation. These teachers have the background to be comfortable differentiating content, straying from the familiar textbook territory, and delving into a variety of instruction strategies, such as in-depth discussions, with their students.",162.0,Honors Students' Perceptions of Their High School Experiences: The Influence of Teachers on Student Motivation,2014.0
"Full-Time Ability Grouping of Gifted Students: Impacts on Social Self-Concept and School-Related Attitudes social and; or emotional development and adjustment; social self-concept; school-related attitudes; ability grouping; longitudinal study; secondary; age/developmental stage Positive socioemotional outcomes and developments represent important educational goals. Full-time ability grouping of gifted students has been criticized for potentially detrimental socioemotional effects. Therefore, in the present longitudinal study, we investigated whether or not social self-concepts and school-related attitudes and beliefs are affected by full-time ability grouping of the gifted. Students in regular classes and students in special classes for the gifted were paralleled for cognitive ability, sex, socioeconomic status, and school. By doing so, we studied 99 statistical twins (N = 198) from the beginning of fifth grade to the middle of sixth grade. Data were analyzed through repeated-measures multivariate analysis of covariance (within-subject factor: time; between-subject factors: class typegifted vs. regularand cognitive ability as covariate). Cognitive ability had hardly any effect on the variables under study. Attending a gifted class had initially positive effects on students' social self-concept of acceptance but no effects on social self-concept of assertiveness. Moreover, children in gifted classes exhibited more interest in school and reported better student-teacher relationships than their counterparts in regular classes.",163.0,Full-Time Ability Grouping of Gifted Students: Impacts on Social Self-Concept and School-Related Attitudes,2014.0
