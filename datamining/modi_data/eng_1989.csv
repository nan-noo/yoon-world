"EDUCATIONAL ENCOURAGEMENT BY PARENTS - ITS RELATIONSHIP TO PRECOCITY AND GENDER   Family involvement and encouragement have significant impact on the eventual display of talent. In the display of mathematical talent, there are large gender differences (Penbow, 1988). Can differences in family encouragement given to gifted females and males help explain this gender gap? The present study addressed that question. It was an investigation into: (1) parental support and encouragement of quantitative and verbal pursuits for extremely mathematically or verbally talented students; (2) the relation of such behaviors to talent development and gender differences, and (3) possible differences in the process for modestly versus extremely gifted students. No major differences were found between parents of extremely precocious children and of modestly gifted children, except a greater paternal involvement for the extremely precocious. Our results did indicate that parents differentiate support as a function of child's talent domain but not as a function of gender. Parents' behaviors were somewhat stereotypical; fathers were more involved in quantitative areas, and mothers tended to be viewed as the primary source of encouragement in verbal areas. It was concluded that the stereotyped behaviors of parents may negatively influence subsequent achievement of gifted females in math/science.",943.0,EDUCATIONAL ENCOURAGEMENT BY PARENTS - ITS RELATIONSHIP TO PRECOCITY AND GENDER,1989.0
"VALIDATION OF A SHORT FORM OF THE WISC-R WITH ACCELERATED AND GIFTED HISPANIC STUDENTS   The summed scores of the WISC-R Similarities and Vocabulary subtests of the Verbal scale, and the Picture Arrangement and Block Design of the Performance scale, used as designated dyads, were cross-validated with the full scale WISC-R Scores for 96 Hispanic students participating in the program for the accelerated and gifted. Results indicate that the Similarities-Vocabulary and the Picture Arrangement-Block Design dyads are potentially useful tools for screening Hispanic students. However, school personnel are cautioned against using these test scores as the only criteria for the selection of Hispanic students for gifted classes.",944.0,VALIDATION OF A SHORT FORM OF THE WISC-R WITH ACCELERATED AND GIFTED HISPANIC STUDENTS,1989.0
WHAT ARE THEY THINKING WHEN WERE TEACHING CRITICAL THINKING   The teaching of critical thinking is an important part of gifted program curricula. This descriptive study address es the issue of the effectiveness of such teaching by comparing student perceptions of a lesson on critical thinking with teachers' stated objectives. The students' perceptions were compared to their teachers' stated objective obtained in separate interviews. Teacher and student responses were stimulated by videotapes of the lessons. The findings indicate that gifted students are able to identify the teacher's intentions and to articulate their own mental processes as they work through a thinking procedure in a lesson.,945.0,WHAT ARE THEY THINKING WHEN WERE TEACHING CRITICAL THINKING,1989.0
"DESIGNING AND USING PEER NOMINATION FORMS   This article focuses on the interplay of four elements to be considered in designing and using peer nomination forms: purpose, characteristics of gifted and talented students, grade level, and item style. Screening, grouping for cooperative learning, discovering special abilities, and designing unique assignments are suggested as possible purposes. Student characteristics are discussed for a variety of orientations and special populations. Issues relative to grade level are introduced. Direct and disguised styles of item construction are explained. The article concludes with instructions for implementation and specific examples of peer nomination forms designed to accommodate a variety of purposes, student characteristics, grade levels, and styles.",946.0,DESIGNING AND USING PEER NOMINATION FORMS,1989.0
"STUDENT LEADERS AND THEIR PARENTS PERCEPTIONS OF THE HOME-ENVIRONMENT   The Family Environment Scale was used to measure the perceptions of students who were attending a leadership training program and those of their parents. Significant differences were found on the Inpependence, Intellectual-Cultural Orientation, and Expressive-ness scales, with the student leaders scoring significantly lower than their parents. Suggestions were offered for developing leadership potential in the home based on the perceived differences.

"SCREENING AND IDENTIFYING STUDENTS TALENTED IN THE VISUAL-ARTS - CLARK DRAWING ABILITIES TEST   Categories of giftedness derived from the influential Marland Report (1972) include students who are gifted in the visual and performing arts. The research reported here describes development, testing, and use of a new instrument, Clark's Drawing Abilities Test, and its success in screening and/or identifying students for a visual arts program for artistically gifted students. The test was admmistered along with the Childrdn's Embedded Figures Test, and the results of both measures subsequently were compared to teacher ratings of students. Significant correlations were obtained among these three measures. Analyses of validity are reported here. Reliability is also reported as expressed in high correlatons among test items.",952.0,SCREENING AND IDENTIFYING STUDENTS TALENTED IN THE VISUAL-ARTS - CLARK DRAWING ABILITIES TEST,1989.0
COMPUTERS AND GIFTED STUDENTS - AN EFFECTIVE MATHEMATICS PROGRAM   Computers were successfully integrated into the mathematics program of gifted fifth and sixth graders. Special emphasis was placed on learning to develop computer programs in order to develop skills in mathematical problem solving. Experience in problem solving with computers can aid in the early attainment of advanced mathematical concepts and can be used for early credit in college level computer science courses.,953.0,COMPUTERS AND GIFTED STUDENTS - AN EFFECTIVE MATHEMATICS PROGRAM,1989.0
"A SURVEY OF PROCEDURES USED FOR IDENTIFYING GIFTED LEARNING-DISABLED CHILDREN   Since the early 1970s, concern for children who are both gifted and handicapped has risen dramatically. Books written about this emerging field deal with identification and programmatic concerns (e.g., Fox, Brody, and Tobin, 1983) and also with case studies illustrating the ways in which the two conditions may coexist (Whitmore and Maker, 1985). This research focuses on the problems involved in identifying the child who is both gifted and learning disabled (GLD). The state of the art is demonstrated by surveying procedures in use in Texas by special education and gifted programs. Results from the survey yield characteristics of GLD children that are consistent with observations in the litetature.",954.0,A SURVEY OF PROCEDURES USED FOR IDENTIFYING GIFTED LEARNING-DISABLED CHILDREN,1989.0
"THE EFFECTS OF SINGLE PARENTHOOD ON SCHOOL-ACHIEVEMENT IN A GIFTED POPULATION   The most obvious social trend affecting families during the past three decades has been the steadily rising number of single-parent households. Research indicates that students from single-parent families demonstrate is lower levels of school achievement than their peers livinq in two-parent homes. However, the impact of single parenthood on gifted children has not been established. A study of children who recently attended the University of Oregon's Summer Enrichment Program for Talented and Gifted Students suggests that the school achievement of gifted students is negatively affected if they come from a single-parent household.",955.0,THE EFFECTS OF SINGLE PARENTHOOD ON SCHOOL-ACHIEVEMENT IN A GIFTED POPULATION,1989.0
"PERCEIVED NEED, TEACHER EFFICACY, AND TEACHING STRATEGIES FOR THE GIFTED AND TALENTED   The study investigated relationships among perceived need, teacher efficacy, and use of ten teaching strategies recommended for the gifted. It also examined differences between expert and novice teachers of the gifted by comparing patterns of need, efficacy, and use in 318 preservice teachers, classroom teachers, and teachers of the gifted. Data were gathered using a seven point Likert-scale questionnaire. Correlations between teacher efficacy and need and between teacher efficacy and use were consistently higher than those between need and use. Preservice teachers, classroom teachers, and teachers of the gifted were successfully separated by a function of need and efficacy, with the most potent contributions made by efficacy variables. Classroom teachers and teachers of the gifted were separated by a function of need, efficacy, and use, with the most powerful contributions made by use of strategies.",956.0,"PERCEIVED NEED, TEACHER EFFICACY, AND TEACHING STRATEGIES FOR THE GIFTED AND TALENTED",1989.0

"PEER NOMINATIONS AS A PSYCHOMETRIC INSTRUMENT - MANY QUESTIONS ASKED BUT FEW ANSWERED   Peer nomination forms (PNFs) are growing in popularity as a screening technique for giftedness. This technique has been judged very favorably by experts in the field. Unfortunately, the research on which these judgments are based is fraught with important methodological weaknesses. A critical analysis of the 13 validation studies of PNFs is presented to justify this assertion. Since PNF's offer advantages that make them a potentially worthy technique, a 4-step blueprint for research on their psychometric qualities is also described: 1) developing a taxonomy of abilities or talents to be assessed by peers, 2) drafting experimental PNFs, 3) evaluating their reliabilities, especially interjudge agreement, 4) conducting rigorous validity studies.",959.0,PEER NOMINATIONS AS A PSYCHOMETRIC INSTRUMENT - MANY QUESTIONS ASKED BUT FEW ANSWERED,1989.0
"CHILD ADJUSTMENT AND PARENT USE OF THE TERM GIFTED   The present study examines the relationship between child adjustment and parent use of the term ""gifted."" Mothers and fathers of 482 children enrolled in a university-based summer enrichment program were assessed on measures of self-concept, anxiety, and peer status. Although over 90% of parents indicated that they think of their child as gifted, approximately 25-30% of the parents refrained from using the term. Use of the term was not associated with IQ or number of years in a gifted program, but children whose parents used the term were consistently less well adjusted on both self-report and peer-report measures. Findings are discussed in the context of theories about the potentially adverse effects of positive labeling on child development. Methodological cautions about the interpretation of these findings are noted.",960.0,CHILD ADJUSTMENT AND PARENT USE OF THE TERM GIFTED,1989.0

"A SPECIAL PROGRAM FOR HIGHLY ABLE RURAL YOUTH IN GRADES 5 AND 6   There are many barriers to appropriate programming for highly gifted students in rural schools. This paper describes an attempt to overcome these barriers. Twp New York State County Boards of Cooperative Services (B.O.C E.S.) cooperated to begin a program for 32 fifth and sixth grade academically advanced students from 19 schools covering 2600 square miles. The local schools sent students one full day a week to one of five sites for advanced level study in humanities and science. Objective and subjective evaluation indicated that the model was successful. Now in its third year, serving 130 students, this model may serve as one approach for small, rural, geographically distant schools.",971.0,A SPECIAL PROGRAM FOR HIGHLY ABLE RURAL YOUTH IN GRADES 5 AND 6,1989.0

"PRACTITIONER OBJECTIONS TO THE ACADEMIC ACCELERATION OF GIFTED-CHILDREN   Despite extensive recent reviews that fail to document harm from early admission and acceleration, many school districts are still reluctant to employ such educational techniques. This paper reports the results of a large, mailed survey of attitudes toward these practices as reported by coordinators of gifted, school psychologists, principals, and teachers (554 respondents) and a follow-up study that explored the origin of such attitudes. The major concern of all groups is the potential for harm to the social and emotional development of accelerants, though coordinators of programs for gifted and talented show significantly more positive views toward early admission and acceleration along every dimension. Personal experience (self or family member) with acceleration was most highly related to positive attitude toward the practice. Respondents viewed early admission and grade skipping as identical. This view, coupled with the prevalence of citations by practitioners of inadequately designed and inappropriately applied ""early admission studies,"" presents an impediment to employment of any acceleration options. Implications for researchers and leaders in the field are discussed.",974.0,PRACTITIONER OBJECTIONS TO THE ACADEMIC ACCELERATION OF GIFTED-CHILDREN,1989.0
