"CURRICULUM FOR THE GIFTED AND TALENTED AT THE SECONDARY LEVEL   Curriculum for the gifted and talented at the secondary level involves more than deciding whether to accelerate or enrich, to group or not, to offer an honors program or an advanced seminar, or to offer advanced placement courses. Rather, it consists of the total learning environment and encompasses the general education, specialized education, co-curricular, and education in non-school settings, together with the climate which is created in the school and classroom for pursuit of excellence. Curriculum planning begins with a clear concept of program goals and objectives. It consists of a number of decisions about content, scope, sequence, integration, articulation and balance, as well as about resource use, time, space, and organization.",1072.0,CURRICULUM FOR THE GIFTED AND TALENTED AT THE SECONDARY LEVEL,1986.0

"DIFFERENTIATING INSERVICE THROUGH TEACHER CONCERNS ABOUT EDUCATION FOR THE GIFTED   Gifted students require differentiated curriculum, and teachers of gifted students require differentiated inservice which addresses their needs with those students. The Concerns-Based Adoption Model (CBAM) developed at the Texas Research and Development Center for Teacher Education provides a framework for developing differentiated inservice. This article describes the use of one CBAM dimension, Stages of Concern About The Innovation, to match inservice opportunities to the needs of teachers.",1074.0,DIFFERENTIATING INSERVICE THROUGH TEACHER CONCERNS ABOUT EDUCATION FOR THE GIFTED,1986.0
"A SURVEY OF PARTICIPANT EXPECTATIONS FOR INSERVICE IN EDUCATION OF THE GIFTED   This survey examines teacher response to techniques utilized in general education and gifted education inservice and staff development. Comments concerning teachers' needs, and most and least beneficial techniques for meeting those needs, were categorizod and the data were analyzed. Survey results indicate that teachers have a variety of expectations for inservice experience and their needs are varied due to differing experience and exposure in the field of gifted education. Results also indicate that inservices spanning a wide range of grade levels are not as helpful as those separated by grade levet or subject area. Therefore, it is recommended that a needs assessment be administered prior to planned inservice in order to assist school personnel and consultants in designing the inservice experience.",1075.0,A SURVEY OF PARTICIPANT EXPECTATIONS FOR INSERVICE IN EDUCATION OF THE GIFTED,1986.0
"PROJECT TARGET - A NEEDS ASSESSMENT APPROACH TO GIFTED EDUCATION INSERVICE   The purpose of Project TARGET (Teacher Assessment Related to Gifted Education Training ) was to deveiop a gifted program inservice training module that is based on a needs assessment approach. The project was funded by the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction and the North Carolina Board of Science and Technology. Specific goals of the project were to develop a needs assessment instrument, administer that instrument, analyze resulting data, develop training modules that responded to assessed needs, and evaluate the results. Evaluation data indicated favorable teacher response to the needs assessment approach and subsequent use of training module activities in teachers' classrooms.",1076.0,PROJECT TARGET - A NEEDS ASSESSMENT APPROACH TO GIFTED EDUCATION INSERVICE,1986.0
TALENTS UNLIMITED - AN INSERVICE EDUCATION MODEL FOR TEACHING THINKING SKILLS   The Talents Unlimited project is an effective inservice education model for training both regular classroom teachers and specialists in gifted education in the development of students' creative and critical thinking skills. Four categories of training activities which comprise this model closely approximate the components which inservice research suggests are critical in helping teachers master new instructionalapproaches: Presentation of theory or description of strategy; modeling of skills; practice in simulated and classroom settings; feedback about performance; and coaching for application of skills to the classroom. The effectiveness of the Talenfs Unlimited model in enhancing teacher skills in the identification and instruction of students with varying backgrounds and diverse abilities is discussed.,1077.0,TALENTS UNLIMITED - AN INSERVICE EDUCATION MODEL FOR TEACHING THINKING SKILLS,1986.0
"LESSONS FROM THE HISTORY OF TEACHER INSERVICE IN ILLINOIS - EFFECTIVE STAFF-DEVELOPMENT IN THE EDUCATION OF GIFTED STUDENTS   The presence of a long term staff development mechanism such as the Area Service Centers in Illinois provides several key lessons regarding the effective utilization of inservice opportunities within a statewide network. The patterns of effectiveness cited in this article have evolved out of a relatively long and rich history of service provision in gifted education. Instructive lessons for gifted education inservice which are featured in this report include attention to real needs, well-planned developmental models, training efforts targeted toward specific outcomes for specific groups, opportunity for followup observation and monitoring, and techniques by which educators can continue personal staff development and renewal.",1078.0,LESSONS FROM THE HISTORY OF TEACHER INSERVICE IN ILLINOIS - EFFECTIVE STAFF-DEVELOPMENT IN THE EDUCATION OF GIFTED STUDENTS,1986.0
"STAGES OF ENTRY FOR TARGET GROUPS PARTICIPATING IN GIFTED PROGRAM INSERVICE AND STAFF-DEVELOPMENT   Some participants in gifted program ISD require only minimal awareness level participation, while others will need to begin at an awareness stage and progress to higher levels of understanding. When pertinent stages of entry level are specified for particular target groups, appropriate inservice and staff development involvement is more likely to occur. Seven stages of staff development are described, with entry and continuation levels designated for target groups involved in gifted programs.",1079.0,STAGES OF ENTRY FOR TARGET GROUPS PARTICIPATING IN GIFTED PROGRAM INSERVICE AND STAFF-DEVELOPMENT,1986.0
"CHARACTERISTICS AND NEEDS OF ADULT LEARNERS IN GIFTED PROGRAM INSERVICE AND STAFF-DEVELOPMENT   The adult learner in inservice and staff development (ISD) for gifted programs requires a learning environment based upon several assumptions of adult education. Adult learners tend to be self-directed with an accumulated wealth of experiences. They have a need for immediate application of learning, and they vaiue problem-centered activities. Participants in gifted program ISD are served best in a collaborative atmosphere where they are involved in self-assessment of needs, mutual goal-planning, use of materials and facilities appropriate for adults, and self-evaluation of learning with supportive feedback and followup.",1080.0,CHARACTERISTICS AND NEEDS OF ADULT LEARNERS IN GIFTED PROGRAM INSERVICE AND STAFF-DEVELOPMENT,1986.0
"HOW TO BE A PROPHET IN YOUR OWN LAND - PROVIDING GIFTED PROGRAM INSERVICE FOR THE LOCAL DISTRICT   Facilitators and coordinators of gifted education often are faced with the task of designing and delivering staff development sessions to peers in their home district.

"ALTERNATIVES FOR THE DESIGN OF GIFTED PROGRAM INSERVICE AND STAFF-DEVELOPMENT   While the importance of staff development and inservice has not been questioned, the benefits derived from such experiences often are challenged. Traditionally, participants who have attended an inservice or staff development are criticized when changes in professional performance or attitudes are not noted. However, factors such as inappropriate expectations, insufficient instructional time, and lack of a support system might be cited as causes that erode the positive effects from staff development and inservice opportunities. Alternative training experiences are described as ways to make staff development and inservice experiences more meaningful to professionals and have greater impact on the students they serve.",1082.0,ALTERNATIVES FOR THE DESIGN OF GIFTED PROGRAM INSERVICE AND STAFF-DEVELOPMENT,1986.0

"TEACHER PERCEPTIONS OF HIGHLY GIFTED STUDENTS IN THE UNITED-STATES AND WEST-GERMANY   Each of 434 German and 446 American high school teachers nominated one student as highly gifted. The teachers aaught native language, mathematics/physics, music/art, or modern foreign language. All estimated what percentage of their students were highly gifted and rated their nominess on 84 characteristics. The percentage of students estimated to be highly gifted was higher for Americans. The characteristics were factor analyzed separately in the two samples and yielded three common factors. A three way MANOVA using these factors as dependent variables found that American students were described as more popular and more achievement-oriented than their German counterparts; Germans were described as slightly more self-centered than the Americans; boys were perceived as more setf-centered than girls.",1085.0,TEACHER PERCEPTIONS OF HIGHLY GIFTED STUDENTS IN THE UNITED-STATES AND WEST-GERMANY,1986.0
"BEING LABELED GIFTED OR TALENTED - MEANINGS AND EFFECTS PERCEIVED BY STUDENTS IN SPECIAL PROGRAMS   Questionnaires were administered to 295 students in summer programs for 9-15 year old academically gifted and artistically talented students, asking for their conceptions of giftedness and talent and their perceptions of the causes and consequences of being so identified. Findings suggested that their stereotypes regarding gifted and talented students were highly positive. These students reported that giftedness can be attained by hard work, that they are not very different from others, and that others treat them well. A minority reported negative reactions from peers.",1086.0,BEING LABELED GIFTED OR TALENTED - MEANINGS AND EFFECTS PERCEIVED BY STUDENTS IN SPECIAL PROGRAMS,1986.0
"UNDERSTANDING A LACK OF MOTIVATION TO EXCEL   Giftedness has often been equated with being academically talented or being a high achiever in in school. Now there is growing concern about those gifted students who could be described as unmotivated and underachieving in one or many academic areas. Parents and teachers who have observed the exceptional potential of these youngsters become intensely frustrated in efforts to increase the students' achievement, motivation and self-discipline. The purposes of this article are to help parents and teachers in understanding the nature and causes of underachievement, and to show them how to work more effectively with underachieving gifted students. The information and guidelines provided will be helpfulin preventing as well as reversing student patterns of attitude and behavior.",1087.0,UNDERSTANDING A LACK OF MOTIVATION TO EXCEL,1986.0

"BEYOND THE USE OF FULL SCALE IQ SCORES   The purpose of the present study was to examine the WISC-R profiles of a sample of intellectually gifted students with respect to idiographic and normative variability in performance between scales and among subtests. The sample consisted of 26 intellectually gifted students (WISC R Full Scale IQ ≥ 130) who had been assessed for possible GT placement. The results of the study indicated that even among a highly homogeneous ability group, significant variability in levels of performance, reflecting individual differences across diverse cognitive ability areas, exist. While 84.6% of the sample was characterized by idiographic strengths and/or weaknesses, 96% of the sample obtained only normatively average-ability scaled scores on one or more WISC-R subtests. Implications for selection decisions and instruction are discussed.",1089.0,BEYOND THE USE OF FULL SCALE IQ SCORES,1986.0
"THE DISCRIMINANT VALIDITY OF GIFTED CHILDRENS DIVERGENT THINKING TEST-SCORES   Previous research suggests that the indices drawn from divergent thinking tests (i.e., ideational fluency, originality, and flexibility) lack discriminant validity. This is a serious problem because of the popularity of these tests, and because divergent thinking is probably our most useful model of creative thinking. Still, the research demonstrating a lack of discriminant validity was conducted primarily with nongifted subjects, and the findings may not apply to gifted individuals. The present project evaluated the discriminant validity of gifted children's (N = 97) divergent thinking test scores with multitrait-multimethod and factor analytic procedures. Results indicated that the indices drawn from the divergent thinking tests did lack discriminant validity in this gifted sample.",1090.0,THE DISCRIMINANT VALIDITY OF GIFTED CHILDRENS DIVERGENT THINKING TEST-SCORES,1986.0
"COGNITIVE-ABILITIES, PERSONALITY AND GENDER DIFFERENCES IN MATH ACHIEVEMENT OF GIFTED ADOLESCENTS   The purposes of this study were to determine whether mathematically gifted boys and girls were significantly different in cognitive abilities and personality factors and to determine whether these cognnve abilities and personality factors were accurate predictors of mathematical achievement. Mathematically gifted boys (n = 77) and girls (n = 62) completed a mathematics reasoning test (SAT-M), a verbal reasoning test (SAT-V), a measure of spatial ability (Group Embedded Figures Test), and personality test (California Psychological Inventory). They received mathematics achievement ratings depending on the number of summer courses completed. The findings indicated that boys not only have higher mathematical reasoning ability than girls, but alslo that this ability is the single best predictor of their mathematical achievement. Verbal ability is the best predictor of mathematical achievement for the girls. For both the girls and the boys, neither spatial reasoning ability nor personality factors significantly predicted mathematical achievement.",1091.0,"COGNITIVE-ABILITIES, PERSONALITY AND GENDER DIFFERENCES IN MATH ACHIEVEMENT OF GIFTED ADOLESCENTS",1986.0
