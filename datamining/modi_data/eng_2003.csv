"Partnerships in science learning: Museum outreach and elementary gifted education   The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of a specially designed museum science program on academically gifted elementary students. The program focused on inquiry-based activities that paralleled the work of museum scientists. A pre- and postattitude questionnaire and a parental questionnaire were used to investigate changes in (a) attitude toward science careers, (b) understanding of scientific work and scientists, and (c) content knowledge gains of participant. A version of the Draw-a-Scientist Test (DAST) was incorporated to gauge student perceptions of scientific work. After participation, students indicated a greater understanding of science careers and an increased desire to explore careers in science. Student questionnaire and an illustration analysis identified an increase in participants' content knowledge and understanding of scientific work. Parental questionnaires supported these findings.",454.0,Partnerships in science learning: Museum outreach and elementary gifted education,2003.0
"Turning the looking glass inside out: A gifted student in an at-risk setting   This qualitative study occurred in as multigrade classroom of 3rd, 4th and 5th graders in a school labelled at-risk. The focal student in this study was Kirby, identified in this setting as a gifted student. Kirby's classroom teacher and a university researcher collaborated in data collection that included interviews, classroom observations, a teacher journal, artifacts, and analysis over a 3-year period that was centered on literacy learning and teaching. It was discovered that the open-ended, flexible learning and teaching that occurred in the classroom benefited Kirby's learning as well as that of the other children in the classroom. Additionally, Kirby benefited from the rich literacy environment that was established by his mother.",455.0,Turning the looking glass inside out: A gifted student in an at-risk setting,2003.0
"Characteristics of effective teachers of gifted students: Teacher background and personality styles of students   This study was designed to explore the characteristics of exceptional teachers of gifted students. Participants included 63 teachers and 1,247 highly able students. Teachers responded to 2 measures: a background questionnaire and the Myers Briggs Type Inventory (MBTI), a self-report personality inventory. Students also completed the MBTI. In response to the background questionnaire, the majority of teachers reported holding advanced degrees in a content area; most were not certified to teach and reported completing no formal coursework in gifted education. Results from the MBTI indicated that exemplary teachers were more likely to prefer N (intuition) and T (thinking), sa compared to a normative teacher sample. The personality types of teachers were in many ways similar to the personality types of the students. These findings suggest that teachers who are judged to be highly effective in working with gifted students prefer abstract themes and concepts, are open and flexible, and value local analysis and objectivity. Results suggest that teacher personality and cognitive style may play a role in his or her effectiveness in teaching gifted students.",456.0,Characteristics of effective teachers of gifted students: Teacher background and personality styles of students,2003.0
"Barriers to aspiration development and self-fulfillment: Interdisciplinary insights for talent discovery   There is increasing concern about the plight of under-privileged gifted and talented children. Insights from disciplines outside our field can inform educators of the gifted about what hinders talent development among the deprived. A model synthesizing constructs from ethical philosophy, sociology and education reveals socioeconomic barriers to aspiration development, capacity development, and self-fulfillment. Various hypothetical life trajectories on the model illustrate the influences of these barriers on long-range talent development towards self-fulfillment and either egotistic individualism or relational altruism. Implications for gifted education include the need for more ethical awareness in the field and more realistic appraisals of hindrances to aspiration formation among the deprived.",457.0,Barriers to aspiration development and self-fulfillment: Interdisciplinary insights for talent discovery,2003.0

"To no longer educate the gifted: Programming for gifted students beyond the era of inclusionism   For many educators, the goal of tprograms for the gifted is ''the education of identified gifted students.'' This article argues that this goal makes gifted and talented (GT) programs vulnerable to discontinuation and relegates gifted children to inclusionary, regular classrooms where their needs are rarely met. To avoid these possibilities, the goal of GT should be reformulated to ''the development of gifted young adults.'' This goal has several advantages, including the possibility of a more enriched curriculum and a more diverse group of children with higher creative productive potential. It also includes the overt recognition that these children require both differentiated instruction and specialized guidance to acquire a measure of expertise, establish a strong sense of self, and make personally satisfying career choices. The Growing Giftedness model presented would have GT students work more closely with adults and with one another than the inclusionary model or part-time gifted programs can allow. In addition this model adumbrates the elements of a full-time program.",461.0,To no longer educate the gifted: Programming for gifted students beyond the era of inclusionism,2003.0
"Diagnosis of ADHD among gifted children in relation to KEDI-WISC and TOVA performance   The following study was conducted to evaluate the correlation between intelligence and a Continuous Performance Test (CPT) that assesses. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in children. Characteristics of attention in gifted children with ADHD were also investigated. A sample of 177 elementary school students was studied, and their attention was measured with the Test of Variables of Attention (T.O.V.A.). About 9.4% of the gifted children were identified with ADHD using the T.O.V.A.) About 9.4% of the gifted children were identified with ADHD using the T.O.V.A., Child Behavior Check List (CBCL) and Teacher's Report Form (TRF). Significant positive correlations were found between intelligence (KEDI-WISC) and omission error, commision error, and response time (RT) variability on the T.O.V.A. That is, children with a high level of intelligence made fewer omission and commision errors and responded more consistently on the T.O.V.A. than children with lower intelligence. No significant correlation was found between intelligence and response time. Overall, gifted children performed better on the T.O.V.A. than nongifted children. Specifically, with the exception of response time variably, gifted children with ADHD performed better on tasks of omission error, commission error, and response sensitivity than nongifted children with ADHD. Further discussions are suggested based on the results mentioned above.",462.0,Diagnosis of ADHD among gifted children in relation to KEDI-WISC and TOVA performance,2003.0
"Gender differences in gifted achievement in Britain and the US   In Britain, the academic acheivements of gifted girls in grade school are surpassing those of gifted boys in almost all areas of study and at all ages, wheras this does not appear to be the case in the U.S. The evidence suggests 2 major reasons for this difference. Emotionally, British girls are now showing greater confidence in their abilities. Educationally, changes in the style and content of British curriculum and assessment may favor female study patterns, along with a national system of inspection that checks for equal gender opportunities in the classroom. Although this managed change in gender equality of opportunity in schools is seen to be highly effective, female school advantage has yet to make a significant difference in the workplace.",463.0,Gender differences in gifted achievement in Britain and the US,2003.0
"Measuring the effectiveness of summer intensive physics courses for gifted students: A pilot study and agenda for research   Students enrolled in 8 summer intensive physics courses for academically gifted students participated in a pilot study to assess the effectiveness of such courses. The students in each class completed the Force Concept Inventory (FCI), and the average normalised gains for each class were compared with previously published data from both year-long high school couses and semester long college courses. The average gains acheived by students in the intensive courses were comparable to those acheived by students in the intensive courses were comparable to those acheived by students in the ordinary-length courses. Recent work in physics education research has made such direct comparisons of standard-length and intensive physics courses possible and also suggests ways to improve student learning in both types of courses. Some further questions for research concerning intensive physics courses for gifted students are discussed.",464.0,Measuring the effectiveness of summer intensive physics courses for gifted students: A pilot study and agenda for research,2003.0
"Early-entrance students: impressions of their first semester of college   Although the long-term impact of early entrance to college has been examined, one issue that has received inadequate attention in the gifted education literature is how students enrolled in early-entrance programs adjust during their first semester of college, which is arguably the most critical juncture for them in terms of their transition from high school. The purpose of this study was to identify the unique academic social, family and transition issues that challenged the inaugural class of the National Academy of Arts, Sciences, and Engineering (NAASE), an early entrance program at the University of Iowa. Through the use of in-depth interviews, behavioral observations, and student and parent surveys, a rich picture of the students satisfaction and challenges with their first-semester college experiences emerged. While the primary aim of this research was to examine the NAASE students first-semester adjustment, the study also served to evaluate the effectiveness of the NAASE program from the students perspectives.",465.0,Early-entrance students: impressions of their first semester of college,2003.0

"Assessing adjustment problems of gifted students in Hong Kong: The development of the student adjustment problems inventory   Ab 18-item inventory, the Student Adjustment Problems Inventory (SAPI-18), was developed to assess the adjustment problems encountered by 290 Chinese secondary students who were nominated by their respective schools to join the Chinese University of Hong Kong gifted programs. The preliminary 32-item version of this inventory was constructed and then revised to reflect gifted students' adjustment problems in school and at home, based on feedback from teachers, students, and parents. The results of item factor analysis of the 32-item version yielded 6 problem dimensions/domains: relationship/ability concerns, unchallenging schoolwork, intense involvement, concerns for being different, parental expectations, and perfectionism. Students' self-report data indicated that strong feelings and involvement, unchallenging schoolwork, and high parental expectations could be common problems among gifted and talented students in Hong Kong. Implications of the findings for meeting the counseling needs of gifted students with adjustment difficulties, as well as suggestions for the refinement of the inventory and for cross-cultural investigations, are discussed.",468.0,Assessing adjustment problems of gifted students in Hong Kong: The development of the student adjustment problems inventory,2003.0
"Elementary and middle school student participation in gifted programs: Are gifted students underserved?   Most researchers agree that special educational programming is advisable for academically gifted students, although the best type of programming is a matter of controversy. Evidence suggests that effective programs combine ability grouping with curricular modification, but little research has addressed the extent to which high-ability students receive special services in their schools. Here, third through sixth graders scoring at or above the 95th percentile on standardized achievement tests reported on their educational experiences. The most common experience was the pull-out program, but many students stated that they were involved in no special programming. Separate analyses for mathematics instruction yielded similar results. Gender, grade level, type of school (public vs. private/parochial), and above-level EXPLORE scores explained little of the variance in special accommodations. The lack of services reported by many participants is particularly surprising given that members of the sample were both highly able and highly motivated.",469.0,Elementary and middle school student participation in gifted programs: Are gifted students underserved?,2003.0
"Impact of gifted programs from the students' perspectives   Fifty college students were interviewed about their prior experiences in gifted programs and their perspectives on the impact of these experience on their lives. Interview questions probed the types of experiences they remembered, including the types of instruction they had, their relations with peers, and their views about how their experiences in gifted programs affected other parts of their lives. Data were analyzed qualitatively with additional topics and themes emerging. In this paper, the author shares their voices and discusses the implications of their reports.",470.0,Impact of gifted programs from the students' perspectives,2003.0
"Factors that differentiate underachieving gifted students from high-achieving gifted students   The purpose of this study was to examine whether gifted achievers and gifted underachievers differ in their general academic self-perceptions, attitudes toward school, attitudes toward teachers, motivation and self-regulation, and goal valuation. The sample consisted of 56 gifted underachievers and 122 gifted achievers from 28 high schools nationwide. Gifted achievers and gifted underachievers differed in their attitudes toward school, attitudes toward teachers, motivation/self-regulation, and goal valuation, but not their academic self-perceptions. In addition, the logistic regression analysis correctly classified over 81% of the sample as either gifted achievers or gifted underachievers using their motivation/self-regulation and goal valuation self-ratings. This study represents an important step toward quantifying factors related to the underachievement of gifted adolescents.",471.0,Factors that differentiate underachieving gifted students from high-achieving gifted students,2003.0
"Addressing underrepresentation of gifted minority children using the Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test (NNAT)   A persistent problem in education is the underrepresentation of diverse students in gifted education programs. Many educators attribute the poor participation of diverse students in gifted programs to the ineffectiveness of standardized tests in capturing the ability of these students. Thus, a primary agenda of school selection committees is to find more culturally sensitive measures. This study examined the effectiveness of the Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test (NNAT) in identifying gifted Black and Hispanic students in comparison to White students. The sample was comprised of 20,270 students in grades K-12 who were similar to the U.S. population on several demographic variables. The distributions of NNAT standard scores were studied separately for White, Black, and Hispanic groups. Results indicate that similar percentages of white (5.6%), Black (5.1%), and Hispanic (4.4%) children earned an NNAT standard score of 125 (95th percentile rank). These findings suggest that the NNAT may be useful as part of a procedure to identify diverse students for gifted education services.",472.0,Addressing underrepresentation of gifted minority children using the Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test (NNAT),2003.0
"Challenges and opportunities for students who are gifted: What the experts say   Five questions were answered by 64 authorities in the gifted field: (a) What do you see as the three greatest identification, assessment, and/or definitional issues in the gifted field? (b) What do you see as the three greatest curricula, instruction, and/or program issues for the gifted student? (c) What are the three most pressing unanswered questions in the gifted field? (d) What have been the three most important research findings in the last 5 years in the gifted field? (e) What are the three most significant developments or innovations in gifted education in the last 5 years? Responses were coded and sorted according to analytic strategy that permitted the descriptive data to be grouped into a small number of categories. Most frequent categories included a need for consensus on how to define, conceptualize, and identify giftedness; new procedures to increase the under-representation of gifted minority students; and the importance of translating research on educational innovations into practice.

"A national study of local and state advocacy in gifted education   This qualitative study examined advocacy in local and state contexts. Sixty-one examples of advocacy from 34 states were summarized through screening surveys sent to state directors of gifted education and to collaborative school districts from the National Research Center on the Gifted and Talented. Six sites were investigated further through case studies leading to the cross-case analysis that is reported in this paper. Overall, the study was guided by 2 questions. First, what do local and state advocacy efforts on behalf of gifted and talented children look like? Second, what factors facilitate positive outcomes for advocates? As defined by advocates, local and state advocacy ranges from short-term efforts in a single school building, to increased services for children, to complex, statewide initiatives to influence legislation, develop policies, and secure funding. Factors that support positive outcomes include advocates who are persistent, knowledgeable about both best practices in gifted education and local/state political processes, and more often collaborative than adversarial. The role of the champion, the importance of advocacy for acceptance, and the practical problem-solving skills and tools of individual advocates and groups of advocates are explored.",477.0,A national study of local and state advocacy in gifted education,2003.0

Understanding the dedication and detail necessary, reaping the benefits of this state's learning curve, and borrowing the strategies found to be successful will help your own organization's efforts. The analogy of bridge building makes concrete the less-tangible phases of getting a mandate for gifted education. This case study gives the blueprints for preparing those who will construct the mandate. Phase 1 entails educating all about the legislative process, building relationships and affiliate groups, getting technical help, and setting goals and making commitments. Phase 2 encompasses gaining recognition, keeping up the commitment, and learning how to compromise. Phase 3 follows a victory by publicizing the benefits, saying thanks, and developing the regulations. Phase 4 looks to the future by maintaining relationships and designing a new vision.
