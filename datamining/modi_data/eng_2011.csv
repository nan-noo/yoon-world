"Being Gifted in Hong Kong: An Examination of the Region's Policy for Gifted Education analysis; gifted education; Hong Kong; policy In Hong Kong, a policy for the education of its gifted students has existed in its current form since 2000. However, the gifted education policy is yet to be evaluated, despite growing calls internationally and locally for increased accountability of public policy, including policies relating to gifted education. Using VanTassel-Baska's five-component model of a high-quality gifted education policy as their conceptual framework, the authors analyze and evaluate the gifted education policy in Hong Kong by first collecting source materials related to the gifted education policy and conducting interviews with three key policy makers. A total of 75 documents and the interview data were subjected to content analysis and the findings indicate that the gifted education policy in Hong Kong has an additional component, which the authors term aims and objectives. Although the aims and objectives differ across the eight groups of beneficiaries, they are not explicitly stated. In addition, the policy neither reflects current research in giftedness nor is it mandated, highlighting possible areas that limit its effectiveness. It is concluded that a thorough update of the policy is warranted if it is to meet its stated aims and objectives.",211.0,Being Gifted in Hong Kong: An Examination of the Region's Policy for Gifted Education,2011.0
"Cognitive and Motivational Characteristics of Elementary Teachers in General Education Classrooms and in Gifted Programs cognitive characteristics; motivational characteristics; teachers; general education classrooms; gifted programs Whether teachers in general education classrooms and in gifted programs differ in their cognitive and motivational characteristics was examined in 182 elementary school teachers. The teacher characteristics examined were epistemological beliefs (beliefs about the nature of knowledge and beliefs about the nature of learning), metacognition (planning, monitoring, and strategy selection), and motivation (self-efficacy, intrinsic motivation, and goal orientation). Teachers in gifted programs reported more sophisticated epistemological beliefs, higher learning-goal orientation, and lower performance-goal orientation than did teachers in general education classrooms. However, perceived use of metacognitive strategies, self-efficacy, and intrinsic motivation were not different between the two groups. Teachers in general reported epistemological sophistication more in the nature of learning than in the nature of knowledge, that they use cognitive strategies more so than planning and monitoring of their activities, and that they are more learning-goal oriented than performance-goal oriented. It is suggested that more courses and trainings are needed for preservice and in-service teachers so they have opportunities to learn and self-reflect on their own characteristics.",212.0,Cognitive and Motivational Characteristics of Elementary Teachers in General Education Classrooms and in Gifted Programs,2011.0
"Grouping for Achievement Gains: For Whom Does Achievement Grouping Increase Kindergarten Reading Growth? achievement grouping; reading achievement; ECLS-K; kindergarten With ever-present budget cuts, teachers often use within-class achievement grouping to meet the needs of students of all ability levels but particularly high-ability students. Using a national database, this study examined the relationship between achievement grouping and the size of achievement groups on kindergarten reading growth. Additionally, it examined whether those relationships differed for kindergarteners in a gifted program. Findings suggest that achievement grouping is related to higher reading achievement, particularly when the average group size is small. Furthermore, although students provided gifted programming at the early grade of kindergarten generally experienced less kindergarten reading growth than their peers, this study suggests the use of achievement grouping provided them the opportunity and instruction to improve their reading achievement during the kindergarten year.",213.0,Grouping for Achievement Gains: For Whom Does Achievement Grouping Increase Kindergarten Reading Growth?,2011.0
"Deferential Differentiation: What Types of Differentiation Do Students Want? curriculum; differentiated curriculum; differentiated instruction; differentiation; gifted; instruction; learning preferences Deferential differentiation occurs when the curriculum modification process defers to students' preferred ways of learning rather than relying on teachers' judgments. The preferences of 416 students identified as gifted (grades 3-8) for features of differentiated curriculum recommended for gifted students were compared with those of 230 students not identified as gifted. While thinking of their favorite school subject, they responded to the 110 items on the Possibilities for Learning survey. Most and least popular items are reported in nine thematic categories (pace, collaborative learning, choice, curriculum content, evaluation, open-ended activities, expert knowledge, teacher/student relationship, and sharing learning). Self-pacing, choice of topic, and choice of workmates were most popular with students in both groups. Compared with nonidentified students, more of the students identified as gifted wanted to learn about complex, extracurricular topics and authentic, sophisticated knowledge and interconnections among ideas; to work with others some of the time; and to choose the format of the products of their learning. More students identified as gifted also disliked waiting for the rest of the class and asking for help. Overall, the groups' preferences differed in degree rather than kind, and reflected cognitive abilities frequently cited as distinguishing characteristics of learners with high ability.",214.0,Deferential Differentiation: What Types of Differentiation Do Students Want?,2011.0

"Beyond Multiple Regression: Using Commonality Analysis to Better Understand R-2 Results commonality analysis; multiple regression; statistics; quantitative methodology Multiple regression is one of the most common statistical methods used in quantitative educational research. Despite the versatility and easy interpretability of multiple regression, it has some shortcomings in the detection of suppressor variables and for somewhat arbitrarily assigning values to the structure coefficients of correlated independent variables. Commonality analysis-heretofore rarely used in gifted education research-is a statistical method that partitions the explained variance of a dependent variable into nonoverlapping parts according to the independent variable(s) that are related to each portion. This Methodological Brief includes an example of commonality analysis and equations for researchers who wish to conduct their own analyses; an Excel spreadsheet that conducts the procedure automatically is available from the journal's supplemental archive or from the author.",218.0,Beyond Multiple Regression: Using Commonality Analysis to Better Understand R-2 Results,2011.0

Analysis of Likert-type responses and brief comments from the students offered guidance for curriculum development and delivery. Differences in a positive direction reflected institutionalization of the group program and support for continuation. However, findings also underscored the need to clarify the purpose of the program to students, select discussion topics carefully, consider gender when forming groups, provide adequate time for group meetings, and provide adequate training for group facilitators.",220.0,Student Response to a Small-Group Affective Curriculum in a School for Gifted Children,2011.0
"Giftedness and Metacognition: A Short-Term Longitudinal Investigation of Metacognitive Monitoring in the Classroom gifted; metacognition; calibration; self-regulated learning The current study investigated differences in metacognition between high school gifted (n = 44) and typical (n = 23) students and examined local calibration accuracy as a potential mechanism for partially explaining superior exam performance by gifted students. Metacognition was measured using student self-reports of metacognitive awareness, acquired at the start of a semester-long course on biology, and students' global (pre- and posttest) and local (item-by-item) confidence judgments to assess monitoring across four biology exams over the course of one semester. Gifted students outperformed typical students on both local and global postdictive measures of calibration. However, there were no statistically significant differences in global predictive judgments or calibration bias. Local, item-by-item calibration accuracy partially mediated the relation between giftedness and exam performance. Implications for both theory and practice are discussed.",221.0,Giftedness and Metacognition: A Short-Term Longitudinal Investigation of Metacognitive Monitoring in the Classroom,2011.0
"Soul Behind the Skill, Heart Behind the Technique: Experiences of Flow Among Artistically Talented Students in Singapore qualitative methodologies; Asian; creativity; flow; artistically talented teenagers Case studies of students enrolled in a specialized secondary school in Singapore describe the experiences of flow among 14 teacher-nominated adolescents talented both in the arts and in academics. Individual in-depth interviews were conducted with the respondents to discern whether they experience flow as they each engage in their respective art forms (visual arts, dance, music, and theater). Qualitative analysis of the interview transcripts reveals elements of the flow state (clear goals, intense concentration, enjoyment, loss of self-consciousness, transformation of time) highly evident among the talented teenagers. Environmental supports that enable expressions of artistic inclinations and identities within the Singapore context were likewise in conjunction with implications for arts-educators and artist-practitioners.",222.0,"Soul Behind the Skill, Heart Behind the Technique: Experiences of Flow Among Artistically Talented Students in Singapore",2011.0
"An Examination of the Relationships Between Ego Development, Dabrowski's Theory of Positive Disintegration, and the Behavioral Characteristics of Gifted Adolescents gifted students; ego development; Dabrowski's theory of positive disintegration; social and emotional development Literature exploring the experiences of gifted individuals has often focused on asynchronous development, particularly during childhood and adolescence. Also discussed in the literature are the unique social, emotional, and behavioral characteristics associated with giftedness. However, there is still an unclear picture concerning the implications of this work as related to the specific counseling needs of gifted students, and little empirical support is provided. This study seeks to build, through a developmental lens, a more comprehensive base from which to design counseling and teaching approaches with gifted students. Findings indicate that the ego levels of gifted students are slightly higher than those of typical adolescents. Empirical evidence of the level of development related to Dabrowski's theory of positive disintegration for gifted adolescents is provided, with the majority of respondents (70%) falling within Dabrowski's Level II-Unilevel Disintegration stage. Results also indicated that the gifted students studied are relatively well adjusted and that the behaviors exhibited by gifted adolescents are normally distributed. Study results are interpreted as indicating that although ego development and Dabrowski's theory of positive disintegration may share similarities, they are different constructs, and further investigation is needed to best use these theories in designing appropriate and effective counseling and teaching intervention strategies for working with gifted adolescents. Limitations of the study and suggestions for future research are presented.",223.0,"An Examination of the Relationships Between Ego Development, Dabrowski's Theory of Positive Disintegration, and the Behavioral Characteristics of Gifted Adolescents",2011.0
"A Primer on Research Ethics in the Field of Gifted Education human subjects research; Institutional Review Boards Most organizations (e. g., institutions of higher education, K-12 school systems) that engage in research with human subjects have institutional review boards (IRBs; also known as research committees) responsible for the oversight of research activities to ensure the ethical treatment of participants. Professional societies such as American Educational Research Association (AERA) and the American Psychological Association (APA) have also developed ethical codes for research activities involving human subjects. Many journals, including GCQ, require that all research considered for publication is accompanied by documentation of review and approval by an IRB or other similar committee. The purpose of this Methodological Brief is to provide researchers, new and experienced, within the field of gifted education a brief introduction to the ethical principles that guide the decision making process of IRBs, to provide examples of what might be considered ethical code violations, and to offer suggestions for working through the review and approval process with IRB officials.(1)",224.0,A Primer on Research Ethics in the Field of Gifted Education,2011.0
"The Dilemmas of Peer Relationships Confronting Mathematically Gifted Female Adolescents: Nine Cases in Taiwan mathematically gifted; adolescence; peer relationships; self-contained classes; pull-out programs There has been a scarcity of research studies addressing the dilemmas of peer relationships confronting gifted adolescent females. In this study, the peer relationships of nine mathematically gifted adolescent females living in Taiwan are explored using a qualitative multicase study. Data analysis revealed six compelling themes: a proclivity for aloneness, indifference to popularity, better rapport with gifted peers, preference for self-contained gifted classes, preference for gifted classes with a majority of boys, and more attachment to family than to friends. Inconsistencies with extant literature offer an opportunity to contemplate the socioemotional issues of mathematically gifted adolescent females from new angles. Putting the Research to Use The results of this study provide some insights into serving the needs of gifted girls. It is important for gifted girls to interact well with peers. However, they also need opportunities to learn to work and play alone, which are beneficial for their development of intrapersonal intelligence. Besides, schools should meet their need to meet and work with other gifted students with similar interests and values. When decisions are made about grouping options, the decisions should be based on the results of empirical studies and also on gifted girls' voice. In addition, some gifted girls may feel torn between their indignation at the gender inequality still existing in the current society and their greater willingness to work with their male peers. They should be assured that it is all right to have this kind of inner conflict and that inner conflict can provide impetus for growth.",225.0,The Dilemmas of Peer Relationships Confronting Mathematically Gifted Female Adolescents: Nine Cases in Taiwan,2011.0
"Student-Identified Exemplary Teachers: Insights From Talented Teachers exemplary teachers; student perceptions of teaching; effective teachers; learning environments; attitudes; teacher quality What roles do teachers play in the development of talent and in the attitude of students toward school? Research indicates that teacher enthusiasm, feedback, and content knowledge are keys to student motivation, learning, and engagement. Research also reveals the importance of positive and supportive student/teacher relationships. In previous work concerning student attitudes toward school, a handful of teachers emerged, in the eyes of their students, as exemplary. Follow-up study provided insights concerning the characteristics, practices, and qualities of these teachers. What and how they teach, and the ways they relate to individual students distinguish these exemplary and talented teachers. This research reveals quantitative and qualitative findings that help to explain the student-identified exemplary teachers (n = 18) from two samples that included more than 400 teachers. Implications for practice based on findings from these exemplary teachers are highlighted.",226.0,Student-Identified Exemplary Teachers: Insights From Talented Teachers,2011.0
"State of Research on Giftedness and Gifted Education: A Survey of Empirical Studies Published During 1998-2010 (April) philosophical/theoretical; qualitative methodologies; evaluation This study surveyed 1,234 empirical studies on giftedness, gifted education, and creativity during 1998-2010 (April), using PsycINFO database and targeted journals as main sources, with respect to main topics these studies focused on, methods they used for investigation, and the conceptual spaces they traversed. Four main research topics emerged from the survey: creativity/creatively gifted, achievement/underachievement, identification, and talent development. Rich and broad conceptual spaces linking these four categories to their psychological underpinnings and educational implications have been explored by this body of research, though the conceptual spaces are still too loosely organized to be seen as paradigmatic. Several prominent trends are identified, including the emergent qualitative studies (accounting for a quarter of the total studies) and the dominance of descriptive (comparative and correlational) research. Although most psychosocial studies are conducted in the context of gifted education, there still seems to be a gap between theory and practice, between psychological understanding of gifted development and promoting such development through education. More systematic, sustainable programs of research and more coordination among researchers are warranted to move the field forward.",227.0,State of Research on Giftedness and Gifted Education: A Survey of Empirical Studies Published During 1998-2010 (April),2011.0
"Competencies and Characteristics for Teaching Gifted Students: A Comparative Study of Beijing and Hong Kong Teachers teachers of gifted students; competencies; characteristics; Beijing; Hong Kong This study examines the competencies and characteristics of in-service teachers who teach gifted students. A total of 511 in-service teachers participated in the study, 334 of whom were from Beijing and 177 were from Hong Kong. The scale developed by D. W. Chan was used as the instrument to examine the competencies and characteristics of the teachers. The Beijing in-service teachers gave significantly higher self-ratings for their characteristics and competencies than the Hong Kong in-service teachers. Beijing in-service teachers who taught in schools for the gifted (supernormal schools) gave the highest ratings for all the variables. This study analyzed the reasons behind why teachers in each city would have such ratings on competencies and characteristics for themselves, and why Beijing teachers (especially those who taught in supernormal schools) would have significantly higher ratings than their Hong Kong counterparts.",228.0,Competencies and Characteristics for Teaching Gifted Students: A Comparative Study of Beijing and Hong Kong Teachers,2011.0
"On the Diagnosis of Learning Disabilities in Gifted Students: Reply to Assouline et al. (2010) assessment; identification; dual exceptionality Gifted students often fail to achieve at a superior level in one or more academic areas. In this reply to an article by Assouline, Nicpon, and Whiteman, the author reviews various explanations for this phenomenon, including motivation/interest, learning opportunities, and error in measuring students' ability-achievement discrepancies. The author also describes different methodologies for investigating whether learning disabilities are overidentified among gifted students and, more broadly, considers the appropriateness of a learning disability diagnosis in students with average achievement. The author concludes with thoughts on the proper interpretation of Assouline et al.'s results.",229.0,On the Diagnosis of Learning Disabilities in Gifted Students: Reply to Assouline et al.

"Cognitive and Psychosocial Characteristics of Gifted Students With Written Language Disability: A Reply to Lovett's Response gifted learning disabled; disorder of written expression Our article describing the characteristics of gifted students with a specific learning disability (SLD) in written language was criticized for emphasizing an ability achievement discrepancy as an indication of a written language disability and for not ruling out alternative explanations for the observed difficulties. The three primary alternative explanations include measurement error, (lack of) motivation, and/or past experiences. In our reply, we offer extensive evidence that refutes these alternative explanations. The critique also offers an interpretation, which we determined to be inaccurate, of our data; therefore, we correct the misinterpretation. We conclude with a confirmation of our original findings: identification of gifted students with specific learning disabilities requires a comprehensive psycho-educational evaluation that includes an examination of the cognitive profile generated from individually-administered tests of ability and achievement. In combination with a psychosocial profile that addresses behavior, self-concept, interests, and motivation, educators have the necessary information to guide them in identifying and developing the unique talents of gifted children with SLD.",230.0,Cognitive and Psychosocial Characteristics of Gifted Students With Written Language Disability: A Reply to Lovett's Response,2011.0

"Academic Giftedness and Alcohol Use in Early Adolescence social and/or emotional development and adjustment; middle school; univariate analyses Adolescence is a period of development particularly vulnerable to the effects of alcohol use, with recent studies underscoring alcohol's effects on adolescent brain development. Despite the alarming rates and consequences of adolescent alcohol use, gifted adolescents are often overlooked as being at risk for early alcohol use. Although gifted adolescents may possess protective factors that likely inhibit the use of alcohol, some gifted youth may be vulnerable to initiating alcohol use during adolescence as experimenting with alcohol may be one way gifted youth choose to compensate for the social price (whether real or perceived) of their academic talents. To address the dearth of research on alcohol use among gifted adolescents the current study (a) examined the extent to which gifted adolescents use alcohol relative to their nongifted peers and (b) examined the adjustment profile of gifted adolescents who had tried alcohol relative to nongifted adolescents who tried alcohol as well as gifted and nongifted abstainers. More than 300 students in seventh grade (42.5% gifted) participated in the present study. Results indicated gifted students have, in fact, tried alcohol at rates that do not differ from nongifted students. Although trying alcohol was generally associated with negative adjustment, giftedness served as a moderating factor such that gifted students who had tried alcohol were less at risk than their nongifted peers. However, evidence also suggests that gifted adolescents who tried alcohol may be a part of a peer context that promotes substance use, which may place these youth at risk for adjustment difficulties in the future. Putting the Research to Use This research demonstrates that a fruitful line of future research would focus on examining the potential mechanisms underlying alcohol use among gifted youth. Individual differences with regard to endorsing a high desirability of gaining social acceptance or fitting in with non-gifted peers or distancing oneself from a gifted image may explain why some gifted students use alcohol and others do not. Until the underlying reasons of alcohol use/experimentation among gifted adolescents are better understood and researched further, it is not clear whether current prevention and intervention programs are effective for this subgroup of adolescents.",232.0,Academic Giftedness and Alcohol Use in Early Adolescence,2011.0
"Empirical Investigation of Twice-Exceptionality: Where Have We Been and Where Are We Going? identification; twice-exceptional; assessment Gifted students with coexisting disabilities, also known as twice-exceptional, are increasingly recognized in America's schools. This increasing awareness needs to be met with equal enthusiasm for empirical investigation into the identification and treatment needs of this group of students. In this article, a 20-year review of the empirical literature examining twiceexceptionality, specifically gifted students with learning disabilities, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or autism spectrum disorder, was conducted. Research strongly suggests that gifted students can have a coexisting disability and that comprehensive, individualized approaches toward diagnosis are necessary. Less is known about effective treatments and interventions that simultaneously highlight strengths and accommodate for areas of growth. Future research directions are offered that ideally will encourage scholars to discover more about effective diagnostic and intervention techniques for this very important group of gifted learners. df",233.0,Empirical Investigation of Twice-Exceptionality: Where Have We Been and Where Are We Going?,2011.0

Ethnographic field methods were used to uncover the essences of the reading experience in the contexts of their daily lives. Data sources included the researcher's field notes, the girls' taped book discussions, parent interviews, and the girls' reading journals. Major findings were that the girls read and make meaning in and around three interconnected areas of intelligence and intensity: intellectual, imaginational, and emotional. As they read fiction, the girls engage in a process of determined growth in each of these domains of human awareness. The girls challenge themselves with difficult literature, critical and empathic thinking, and problem finding. As the girls read and make meaning, they are involved in constructing their lives' purpose.

"The Effects of Acceleration on High-Ability Learners: A Meta-Analysis acceleration; meta-analysis; high-ability learners; academic achievement; social emotional development Current empirical research about the effects of acceleration on high-ability learners' academic achievement and social-emotional development were synthesized using meta-analytic techniques. A total of 38 primary studies conducted between 1984 and 2008 were included. The results were broken down by developmental level (P-12 and postsecondary) and comparison group (whether the accelerants were compared with same-age, older, or mixed-age peers). The findings are consistent with the conclusions from previous meta-analytic studies, suggesting that acceleration had a positive impact on high-ability learners' academic achievement (g = 0.180, 95% CI = -.072, .431, under a random-effects model). In addition, the social-emotional development effects appeared to be slightly positive (g = 0.076, 95% CI = -.025, .176, under a random-effects model), although not as strong as for academic achievement.

Results showed that for the sample of gifted students used in this study, regardless of age, males outperformed females on the math and science subtests with the most pronounced differences on the math subtests, whereas females outperformed males on the verbal subtests. All these differences between genders did not diminish over the 9-year period but were steady with small or negligible effect sizes. The ratios of males to females in specific score ranges on the off-level tests were also steady and consistent, favoring males at the highest end in math and science with the maximum ratio of 3:1 and females at the highest end in verbal areas with the maximum ratio of 2:1.
