"The Impact of the Nomination Stage on Gifted Program Identification: A Comprehensive Psychometric Analysis identification; nomination; psychometrics; sensitivity; ROC The use of the nomination stage as the first step in the identification process is pervasive across the field of gifted education. In many cases, nominations are used to limit the number of students who will need to be evaluated using costly and time-consuming assessments for the purpose of gifted program identification and placement. This study evaluated the effect of the nomination stage on the overall efficacy of a gifted identification system. Results showed that in nearly all conditions, identification systems that require a nomination before testing result in a large proportion of gifted students being missed. Under commonly implemented conditions, the nomination stage can cause the false negative rate to easily exceed 60%. Changes to identification practices are urgently needed in order to ensure that larger numbers of gifted students receive appropriate educational placement and to maintain the integrity of gifted education services.",99.0,The Impact of the Nomination Stage on Gifted Program Identification: A Comprehensive Psychometric Analysis,2016.0
"Inattentional Blindness in 9-to 10-Year-Old Intellectually Gifted Children inattentional blindness; attention; intelligence; intellectually gifted children Researchers suggest that while intellectually gifted children might not always display adequate focus on their general life, they perform very well on experimental attentional tasks. The current study used inattentional blindness (IB) paradigm to understand better the attentional abilities of intellectually gifted children. Specifically, we examined whether intellectually gifted children were more able to avoid IB while performing well on certain attentional tasks. An experiment was carried out that involved 44 intellectually gifted and 45 average children. Results showed that intellectually gifted children, whose IB rate was 18.6%, were less susceptible to IB than average children, whose IB rate was 46.5%, (2)(1) = 7.626, p = .006. Intellectually gifted children performed better on the primary attentional tasks than average children when unexpected stimuli occurred. Findings suggest that intellectually gifted children are more likely to maintain attention on current task but are more prone to process additional stimuli. Overall, the present study argues that general intelligence may affect IB.",100.0,Inattentional Blindness in 9-to 10-Year-Old Intellectually Gifted Children,2016.0
"Hidden in Plain Sight: The Experiences of Three Twice-Exceptional Students During Their Transfer to High School twice-exceptional; qualitative; transfer experiences; transition; capability approach Twice-exceptional students are characterized by the almost paradoxical combination of giftedness accompanied by learning difficulties that hinder their ability to reach their potential in a traditional academic setting. This qualitative study examined the experiences of three twice-exceptional students during transfer to a New Zealand high school. Successful transfer has been shown to be dependent on factors such as the timely handover of accurate and complete student records. Barriers to successful transfer result in disruption in curriculum continuity, which can be especially detrimental for learners with special needs. Using student voice data from interviews and journal entries, the participants' lived experiences of the transfer process were revealed. Findings suggest that the way in which the twice-exceptional students experienced transfer influenced the development of their personal capabilities as learners in the education setting.",101.0,Hidden in Plain Sight: The Experiences of Three Twice-Exceptional Students During Their Transfer to High School,2016.0
"Giftedness and Overexcitability: Investigating the Relationship Using Meta-Analysis overexcitability; giftedness; Dabrowski; meta-analysis; research synthesis; systematic review Current textbooks, websites, research articles, and popular resources have stated that gifted individuals have longer and more pronounced responses to stimuli than the general population. This overexcitable nature of gifted persons has provided a commonly used lens to conceptualize, identify, and understand giftedness and gifted persons' behaviors. Yet there are reasons to be skeptical about the evidence demonstrating that the gifted population is more overexcitable than the nongifted population. A meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the existence and strength of the giftedness-overexcitability (OE) relationship as presented in a number of studies comparing the OE scores of intellectually gifted and nongifted samples. Gifted samples were found to have higher mean OE scores than nongifted samples. However, the effect size for psychomotor OE was not statistically significant, while the effect sizes for the emotional and sensual OEs were small. Calculated effect sizes for intellectual and imaginational OEs were medium. A number of important limitations and implications exist.",102.0,Giftedness and Overexcitability: Investigating the Relationship Using Meta-Analysis,2016.0
"RETRACTED: Effects of Violent Media on Verbal Task Performance in Gifted and General Cohort Children(Retracted article. See vol. 61, pg. 153, 2017) violent media; giftedness; IQ; sensitivity; verbal task performance Violent media immediately grab our attention. However, violent media also detract attention from other cues. A large body of research shows that violent media impair attention and memory, critical resources for academic performance, such as verbal tasks at school. The present study tested whether gifted children are more insulated or more vulnerable to these violent media effects. Gifted (n = 74) and general cohort (n = 80) 10-year-old children were randomly assigned to watch a 12-minute violent or nonviolent cartoon. A verbal task was completed before and after the video. Results showed that gifted children outperformed general cohort children on the verbal task after watching a nonviolent cartoon, but not after watching a violent cartoon. Thus, the violent video eliminated the typical advantage gifted children have on verbal tasks. These findings suggest that the harmful effects of violent media on verbal tasks are greater for gifted children than for general cohort children.",103.0,"RETRACTED: Effects of Violent Media on Verbal Task Performance in Gifted and General Cohort Children(Retracted article.

"Equity and Excellence: Proactive Efforts in the Identification of Underrepresented Students for Gifted and Talented Services identification; underrepresentation; assessment; theoretical definitions The identification of gifted and talented students and the accompanying fact that most identification systems result in the underrepresentation of students from African American, Hispanic, Native American, English language learning, and low-income families are two of the most discussed and hotly debated topics in the field. This article provides an overview of past efforts to mitigate inequity in both K-12 and higher education program identification, highlights successes and limitations, and presents a particular perspective in order to help facilitate broader thinking about the purpose of identification, the development of talent, and how academic excellence can be fostered while simultaneously increasing equity in gifted education.",104.0,Equity and Excellence: Proactive Efforts in the Identification of Underrepresented Students for Gifted and Talented Services,2016.0
"Drawing Upon Lessons Learned: Effective Curriculum and Instruction for Culturally and Linguistically Diverse Gifted Learners curriculum; qualitative methodologies; special populations/underserved; gifted Javits Gifted and Talented Education Program has provided a wealth of knowledge on culturally and linguistically diverse (CLD) gifted learners and how to support teachers in their work with CLD students. This study examined five impactful Javits projects through qualitative inquiry centered on how innovative practice takes root or not. Using grounded theory tradition, examination of Javits project participation enabled insight into how educators act and react to innovation as well as their perceptions of CLD student impacts. Data sources (documents, conversations with principal investigators, and interviews with 14 educators) provide evidence for what sustains effective, research-based practices and explores continued student benefits. Major findings are (a) context matters in sustaining innovation, (b) powerful curriculum and instruction can transform teaching and teachers, and (c) student impacts continue. Data point to leadership as an underlying element in sustaining innovation. Leaders ensure that innovation extends from broad-based goals; they develop innovation through scale-up and involvement of others; they purposefully track results. Growing effective approaches is critical to access and opportunity and CLD-gifted learners' talent development.",105.0,Drawing Upon Lessons Learned: Effective Curriculum and Instruction for Culturally and Linguistically Diverse Gifted Learners,2016.0
"Openness to Experience Rather Than Overexcitabilities: Call It Like It Is openness to experience; overexcitabilities; five-factor model of personality; structural equation modeling; quantitative methodologies; social and/or emotional development and adjustment Openness to experience is a personality factor in the five-factor model of personality, and it is composed of six facets. Facets of openness appear conceptually analogous to overexcitabilities (OEs), which are displays of inner energy guiding individuals toward advanced potential according to the theory of positive disintegration. This study examined the similarity of OEs to corresponding openness to experience facets in a sample of 149 creative adolescents and adults and 312 adults from the general population (total N = 461). Exploratory structural equation modeling tested competing models in which each OE and corresponding openness facet were modeled as separate factors and as joint factors. The separate-factor model had acceptable fit but uninterpretable loadings, while the joint-factor model had acceptable fit and interpretable loadings; thus, openness seems to encompass OEs. Accordingly, the field should align with well-researched psychological theories like the five-factor model of personality and begin to talk about openness rather than OEs.",106.0,Openness to Experience Rather Than Overexcitabilities: Call It Like It Is,2016.0
"Teachers' Conceptions of Gifted and Average-Ability Students on Achievement-Relevant Dimensions teachers' subjective theories; harmony hypothesis; disharmony hypothesis; definition and/or conception of giftedness/talent; vignettes; professional development; multivariate analyses Stereotyping of gifted students may not only hinder identification and actualization of potential but also personality development (stigma of giftedness). This is obvious in the case of negative stereotyping (e.g., the disharmony hypothesis, which sees gifted students as intellectually strong, but emotionally and socially inferior), but even overly positive stereotypes (e.g., the harmony hypothesis, which sees gifted students as superior in all respects) may prove harmful in that they put gifted students under pressure. In this study, we examined whether teachers' conceptions of the gifted are in line with either of these stereotypes. In a between-subjects design using vignettes, 246 German teachers rated fictitious students varying in ability level (gifted/average), gender (girl/boy), and age (8/15 years) on intellectual ability, motivation, prosociality, and maladjustment. Strong measurement invariance across vignette types was demonstrated for all dimensions. A repeated-measures analysis of variance of latent factor scores of the four dimensions showed that teachers considered gifted students more able, but less prosocial and more maladjusted than average-ability students. Whereas higher intellectual ability is in line with empirical findings about the gifted, lower social ability and higher maladjustment are not. Implications for theory, research, and educational practice are discussed.",107.0,Teachers' Conceptions of Gifted and Average-Ability Students on Achievement-Relevant Dimensions,2016.0
"The Aurora-a Battery as an Assessment of Triarchic Intellectual Abilities in Upper Primary Grades assessment; factor analysis; quantitative methodologies; elementary; age/developmental stage; creativity; programming/service delivery models The theory of triarchic intelligence posits that, in addition to the widely acknowledged analytical reasoning abilities, creative and practical abilities should be included in the assessments of intellectual capacities and identification of gifted students. To find support for such an approach, the present study examined the psychometric properties of the Aurora-a Assessment Battery of triarchic abilities in the upper primary grades. To assess the dimensional structure of the Aurora-a Assessment Battery, we analyzed subtest scores of 499 elementary school children. Correlational and factor analyses showed a poor fit between Aurora-a subtest scores and the triarchic theory of intelligence, indicating deficiencies in either the triarchic theory or the design of the Aurora-a Battery. Researchers should sustain their current efforts to evaluate the validity of various theories of intelligence and to develop theory-based assessment instruments.",108.0,The Aurora-a Battery as an Assessment of Triarchic Intellectual Abilities in Upper Primary Grades,2016.0

"Consistency of the Performance and Nonperformance Methods in Gifted Identification: A Multilevel Meta-Analytic Review gifted identification; performance methods; nonperformance methods; efficiency; effectiveness; sensitivity; specificity Current approaches to gifted identification suggest collecting multiple sources of evidence. Some gifted identification guidelines allow for the interchangeable use of performance and nonperformance identification methods. This multiple criteria approach lacks a strong overlap between the assessment tools; however, interchangeable use of the instruments (replacing one for another) entails high regularity. This meta-analytic review investigated the consistency of using performance and nonperformance identification methods by examining the influence of three moderators in two different study analyses. Study 1 focused on correlational and comparison studies by using Pearson r as the index of effect size within a three-level multilevel design. Study 2 was conducted with three diagnostic proportional metrics: efficiency, effectiveness/sensitivity, and specificity. Results from Study 1 indicated the overall correlation between the performance and nonperformance gifted identification methods was medium (r = .30). Teacher ratings yielded significantly higher consistency with performance measures than teacher or parent nomination and self-ratings. Study 2 showed that nonperformance methods are relatively strong in terms of specificity (70%) and effectiveness/sensitivity (59%) but not very efficient (39%). Analyses of four diagnostic quadrants indicated that performance and nonperformance gifted identification methods, when used alone, tend to identify different students who would not be identified otherwise despite some amount of convergence between the two. Our findings indicated that nonperformance and performance gifted identification methods cannot replace each other. They should be used concurrently rather than be used alone or consecutively.",110.0,Consistency of the Performance and Nonperformance Methods in Gifted Identification: A Multilevel Meta-Analytic Review,2016.0
"A Meta-Analysis of the Effects of Enrichment Programs on Gifted Students meta-analysis; enrichment programs; gifted students; evaluation Although descriptions of enrichment programs are valuable for practitioners, practices, and services for gifted students, they must be backed by evidence, derived through a synthesis of research. This study examined research on enrichment programs serving gifted students and synthesized the current studies between 1985 and 2014 on the effects of enrichment programs. A total of 26 studies were included in this meta-analysis, and the findings show that enrichment programs had a positive impact on both gifted students' academic achievement (g = 0.96, 95% CI [0.64, 1.30], under a random-effects model) and socioemotional development (g = 0.55, 95% CI [0.32, 0.79], under a random-effects model). Regarding moderators of the effects, types of programs, and grade levels influenced both effect sizes of academic achievement and socioemotional development. The largest effect size was observed for summer residential programs in terms of academic achievement and for a combination of summer and academic year program in terms of socioemotional development.",111.0,A Meta-Analysis of the Effects of Enrichment Programs on Gifted Students,2016.0
"A Meta-Analysis of the Relationship Between Three Common PsychopathologiesADHD, Anxiety, and Depressionand Indicators of Little-c Creativity little-c creativity; psychopathology; ADHD; anxiety; depression; meta-analysis; assessments There is a long-standing controversy over the relationship between psychopathology and creativity. Yet there is a lack of evidence regarding the relationship between common psychopathologies and indicators of little-c, or every day, creativity among laypeople. To make sense of this connection, we conducted a meta-analysis using 89 studies to reveal the overall relationships between the most common psychopathologies and little-c creativity and uncover the source of variance in the relationships. The 89 studies involved 35,271 participants and the common psychopathologies: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, and depression. Results indicated that the overall mean effect size was not different from zero (r = -.06, k = 261, 95% confidence interval [-.15, .02]) with substantial heterogeneity. Variability of effect sizes was examined by five moderators: assessment of psychopathology, assessment of creativity, age, gender, and intelligence of participants. Specifically, the moderator analyses showed that effect sizes varied by assessment of both psychopathology and creativity as well as level of intelligence.",112.0,"A Meta-Analysis of the Relationship Between Three Common PsychopathologiesADHD, Anxiety, and Depressionand Indicators of Little-c Creativity",2016.0

"Does Completing an Enriched Writing Course Improve Writing Self-Efficacy of Talented Secondary Students? writing self-efficacy; gifted; talented; writing program; final grade This study examined whether writing self-efficacy would change and have an effect on final course grade in 267 talented middle and high school students in the course of taking enriched 6-week writing classes. Confidence in writing increased across time within three courses, whereas approach to writing did not. Differences were found between genders and between students taking different courses. In the writing process class, girls scored higher in their approach to writing at the end of class than boys. Girls obtained higher final grades than boys, but girls who had higher change in approach to writing obtained higher final grades than (a) boys who reported a higher change and (b) both boys and girls who reported less change.

"Five Reasons to Put the g Back Into Giftedness: An Argument for Applying the Cattell-Horn-Carroll Theory of Intelligence to Gifted Education Research and Practice definition and/or conception of giftedness/talent; differentiation; human intelligence; philosophical/theoretical Human intelligence (also called general intelligence, g, or Spearman's g) is a highly useful psychological construct. Yet, since the middle of the 20th century, gifted education researchers have been reluctant to discuss human intelligence. The purpose of this article is to persuade gifted education researchers and practitioners to reincorporate modern human intelligence theory (as expressed in Cattell-Horn-Carroll, or CHC, theory) and research into their work on gifted children. There are five reasons to make intelligence part of gifted education research: (a) intelligence is one of the best studied constructs in psychology; (b) educators know more about how to adjust educational plans in response to intelligence than many other traits; (c) grounding research in CHC theory strengthens the links between gifted education and psychology, making gifted education more relevant to outsiders; (d) intelligence is an excellent predictor of long-term general life outcomes; and (e) many issues in gifted education (such as curriculum planning and underidentification) are best understood if considered in relation to intelligence and related cognitive abilities. The article ends with some caveats that gifted education researchers should keep in mind when integrating human intelligence research and CHC theory into their work.",116.0,Five Reasons to Put the g Back Into Giftedness: An Argument for Applying the Cattell-Horn-Carroll Theory of Intelligence to Gifted Education Research and Practice,2016.0
"The Psychological Well-Being of Early Identified Gifted Children gifted; identification; intelligence; creativity; psychological well-being This study examined the psychological well-being of gifted primary school children. From a screening sample of 233 children in Grades 1 and 2 across five schools in the Netherlands, 35 children achieving high scores on two out of three selection criteria (teacher nomination, creativity, and nonverbal reasoning ability) and 34 typically developing children were selected to participate in the study. Combinations of grouping criteria were used to create different subsamples within the gifted sample. In general, the differences in well-being between the gifted and the comparison group were relatively small, although the gifted children experienced lower self-worth and social acceptance. In contrast, within the sample of gifted children, some differences were found between selected subgroups. Highly creative gifted children experienced lower feelings of well-being than less creative gifted children, while the reverse was true for children who were nominated by their teacher. Additionally, high-performing gifted children showed higher psychological well-being than underachievers.",117.0,The Psychological Well-Being of Early Identified Gifted Children,2016.0
"How to Learn Things at School You Don't Already Know: Experiences of Gifted Grade-Skippers in Germany qualitative methodologies; social and/or emotional development and adjustment; acceleration; grade-skipping Skipping a grade, one specific form of acceleration, is an intervention used for gifted students. Quantitative research has shown acceleration to be a highly successful intervention regarding academic achievement, but less is known about the social-emotional outcomes of grade-skipping. In the present study, the authors used the grounded theory approach to examine the experiences of seven gifted students aged 8 to 16 years who skipped a grade. The interviewees perceived their feeling of being in the wrong place before the grade-skipping as strongly influenced by their teachers, who generally did not respond adequately to their needs. We observed a close interrelationship between the gifted students' intellectual fit and their social situation in class. Findings showed that the grade-skipping in most of the cases bettered the situation in school intellectually as well as socially, but soon further interventions, for instance, a specialized and demanding class- or subject-specific acceleration were added to provide sufficiently challenging learning opportunities.",118.0,How to Learn Things at School You Don't Already Know: Experiences of Gifted Grade-Skippers in Germany,2016.0
