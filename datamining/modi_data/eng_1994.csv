"IDENTIFYING YOUNG, POTENTIALLY GIFTED, ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED-STUDENTS   In this paper we present a rationale for and a description of the procedures developed by the staff of Project Synergy for identifying economically disadvantaged, potentially gifted kindergarten students in urban schools. This approach emphasizes the development of site-appropriate methods, observation, dynamic assessment, and the concept of best performance; it de-emphasizes the use of standardized tests. Validation data are presented and discussed.",749.0,"IDENTIFYING YOUNG, POTENTIALLY GIFTED, ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED-STUDENTS",1994.0
"A COMPARISON OF THE SCHOOL INTRINSIC MOTIVATION AND PERCEIVED COMPETENCE OF GIFTED AND REGULAR STUDENTS   The purpose of this study was to compare the school intrinsic motivation and perceived competence of gifted and regular students. To this end, 135 elementary school French-Canadian students (Grade 4 to Grade 6) completed Harter's Intrinsic/Extrinsic Orientation Scale as well as the Cognitive Perceived Competence Scale. Results indicated that gifted students perceived themselves as being more competent and intrinsically motivated toward school activities than regular students. No gender effects were obtained. These results provide support for Deci and Ryan's (1985) cognitive evaluation theory, and the use of this theory in future intrinsic motivation research within the realm of education is recommended.",750.0,A COMPARISON OF THE SCHOOL INTRINSIC MOTIVATION AND PERCEIVED COMPETENCE OF GIFTED AND REGULAR STUDENTS,1994.0
"GIFTED ADOLESCENTS ATTITUDES TOWARD THEIR GIFTEDNESS - A PARTIAL REPLICATION   Kerr, Colangelo, and Gaeth (1988) assessed gifted adolescents' perceptions of their own and others' views of and reactions to their giftedness in personal, academic, and social areas through an open-ended questionnaire. Their results showed that the gifted adolescents' ''views of their giftedness were not unidimensional'' (p. 245). The purpose of the present study was to further Kerr et al.'s (1988) investigation by tailoring the questions to individuals' experiences and expanding the scoring scheme within response type. Results show that views of the gifted label and its effects are multifaceted, varying in ways different from those previously noted. Gifted adolescents may be coming to realize that there are positive and negative aspects to almost all social roles, statuses, and labels.",751.0,GIFTED ADOLESCENTS ATTITUDES TOWARD THEIR GIFTEDNESS - A PARTIAL REPLICATION,1994.0
"MORE FROM THE WATER JARS - A REANALYSIS OF PROBLEM-SOLVING PERFORMANCE AMONG GIFTED AND NONGIFTED CHILDREN   An earlier study of performance on water-jar combination problems concluded that giftedness (defined by superior school performance) is associated with metacognitive strength and flexibility in breaking an induced response set. Breaking sets is useful in bringing new perspectives to problem solving. Water-jar studies traditionally drop children who did not form the set, in this case 40% of the initial sample. The present study reanalyzed the initial data but did not exclude the previously omitted subjects. Gifted subjects who failed to form the set actually made the most errors of any group, and they were more likely not to recognize that they had made these errors. Other children who never formed the set were much like those who did. Therefore, gifted children do not always outperform others on cognitive tasks. There may be motivational reasons for this inferior performance.",752.0,MORE FROM THE WATER JARS - A REANALYSIS OF PROBLEM-SOLVING PERFORMANCE AMONG GIFTED AND NONGIFTED CHILDREN,1994.0
"DEFINITIONS, IDEOLOGIES, AND HYPOTHESES IN GIFTED EDUCATION   This article argues that issues in gifted education and the study of giftedness can be usefully categorized under three headings: definitions, ideologies, and hypotheses. Seven central issues regarding educational programs for the gifted are classified according to their basic orientation: (a) level of excellence and the gifted label, (b) types of giftedness, (c) individual versus societal perspectives on the gifted, (d) giftedness in different ethno-cultural backgrounds, (e) origins of giftedness, (f) procedures for identifying and screening the gifted, and (g) effectiveness of educational programs. These issues are either definition oriented (a and b), ideology oriented (c and d), or hypothesis oriented (e, f, and g). It is argued that practitioners and researchers must pay attention to the type of issue being discussed so that discussions and controversies concerning giftedness will be relevant and productive.",753.0,"DEFINITIONS, IDEOLOGIES, AND HYPOTHESES IN GIFTED EDUCATION",1994.0

"PRACTICES OF PRESERVICE TEACHERS RELATED TO GIFTED AND OTHER ACADEMICALLY DIVERSE LEARNERS   Preservice teachers face formidable tasks of planning and management as they enter the classroom for the first time as professionals. They also bring with them mental imprints of what teaching and learning are like, images gained not from their professional preparation programs, but from their years as students. Once in the role of teacher, those views may be reinforced by the circumstances of their apprenticeship. This qualitative study reports five themes in the preservice teaching experience of 10 preservice teachers which may reinforce traditional views of schooling and discourage understanding and addressing unique learning needs of academically diverse learners such as gifted, remedial, and special education learners.",760.0,PRACTICES OF PRESERVICE TEACHERS RELATED TO GIFTED AND OTHER ACADEMICALLY DIVERSE LEARNERS,1994.0
"COMPARISON OF TRAINED AND UNTRAINED TEACHERS OF GIFTED STUDENTS   Leaders in the field of gifted education have presented models for both instructional programs for gifted students and correlated teacher training, but research on or evaluation of the effects of these training models is meager. This study showed that teachers trained in gifted education demonstrated greater teaching skills and developed more positive class climates than did teachers who had no training in gifted education. Students of GT trained teachers reported greater emphasis on higher level thinking skills and on discussion, and less emphasis on lecture and grades than did students of untrained teachers.",761.0,COMPARISON OF TRAINED AND UNTRAINED TEACHERS OF GIFTED STUDENTS,1994.0
"ARE TEACHERS REALLY POOR TALENT DETECTORS - COMMENTS ON PEGNATO AND BIRCH (1959) STUDY OF THE EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY OF VARIOUS IDENTIFICATION TECHNIQUES   This article reanalyses Pegnato and Birch's data in their often cited 1959 article. especially their measures of effectiveness and efficiency. The author shows that these two concepts are not independent, as usually assumed in studies examining the criterion-related validity of various identification techniques for the gifted and talented. Rather, both are related to the number of subjects singled out as a result of the cutoff value chosen to implement the method. Consequently, most comparisons made between and within methods become invalid. A simple alternative is presented: compare the correlation coefficients of the predictors with the criterion. It is concluded that this methodological flaw, as well as some other technical limitations, invalidates the most often cited observation from that study, namely, that teacher nominations should not be relied upon as an identification technique for the gifted and talented.",762.0,ARE TEACHERS REALLY POOR TALENT DETECTORS - COMMENTS ON PEGNATO AND BIRCH (1959) STUDY OF THE EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY OF VARIOUS IDENTIFICATION TECHNIQUES,1994.0
"THE IMPACT OF STAFF-DEVELOPMENT ON TEACHERS ABILITY TO MODIFY CURRICULUM FOR GIFTED AND TALENTED STUDENTS   In this study, three levels of staff development were provided to elementary teachers to train them in a technique called curriculum compacting. Teachers in 20 school districts across the country were randomly assigned by district to one of three treatment groups that received different levels of staff development. After receiving training in curriculum compacting (a procedure that enables teachers to eliminate previously mastered curriculum and substitute more challenging alternatives), teachers were able to eliminate between 42% and 54% of the content for the high-ability students they selected. Teachers in Treatment Group 3, who received the most intensive staff development, completed the highest rated compactor forms. The majority of the teachers in the study were enthusiastic about the process of modifying curriculum for high-ability students, reinforcing Guskey's (1986) model of the process of teacher change.",763.0,THE IMPACT OF STAFF-DEVELOPMENT ON TEACHERS ABILITY TO MODIFY CURRICULUM FOR GIFTED AND TALENTED STUDENTS,1994.0
"A GIFTED CHILDS EDUCATION REQUIRES REAL DIALOG - THE USE OF INTERACTIVE WRITING FOR COLLABORATIVE EDUCATION   This paper reports the findings of two studies which compared the responses to using dialogue journals by teachers of the gifted and talented and their students. The purpose of this research was to learn more about the ways that such interactive writing can enable GT students to collaborate effectively in their own education. Study 1 sought to determine the types of discourse functions teachers used in the journals they kept with their instructor in a graduate practicum and with the GT students they taught in that practicum. They interacted differently with their instructor than with their students in ways consistent with their role: they commonly used questions, a controlling behavior, when journaling with students. Study 2 examined whether teachers could vary their responses to students' journals to make them more collegial and less controlling. Together these studies supported the use of dialogue journals to promote mutuality in the educational process.",764.0,A GIFTED CHILDS EDUCATION REQUIRES REAL DIALOG - THE USE OF INTERACTIVE WRITING FOR COLLABORATIVE EDUCATION,1994.0
"BEING A TEACHER - EMOTIONS AND OPTIMAL EXPERIENCE WHILE TEACHING GIFTED-CHILDREN   The emotions experienced by teachers while teaching is a relatively unexplored avenue of research. One teacher, Alex, was studied using phenomenological interviews and participant observation to understand the emotions he experienced while teaching in a special program for gifted and talented children. Data were analyzed using inductive procedures. Alex experienced a variety of emotions generated when the instructional dynamics of the lesson were congruent or incongruent with his professional practical knowledge. Most of his emotions were positive. A compelling emotional state, ''being a teacher,'' was found to incorporate many of his feelings and was found repeatedly in his classes. Alex seemed to be trying to recreate being a teacher as he taught. His emotional state was interpreted to be isomorphic to what Csikszentmihalyi (1990) calls ''optimal experience.'' The findings suggest that the special class setting established conditions which increased the probability that Alex would be having an optimal experience.",765.0,BEING A TEACHER - EMOTIONS AND OPTIMAL EXPERIENCE WHILE TEACHING GIFTED-CHILDREN,1994.0

"PORTFOLIO ASSESSMENT - A KEY TO IDENTIFYING HIDDEN TALENTS AND EMPOWERING TEACHERS OF YOUNG-CHILDREN   Early Assessment for Exceptional Potential of Young Minority and/or Economically Disadvantaged Students is a project which used portfolio assessment as a means of identifying and of developing instructional plans for children in kindergarten to third grade. The project assumed that there are universal identifiers of exceptional potential and that teachers could learn to recognize children with potential in their classrooms if they were provided with authentic examples (videotaped and written) of such behavior. Once identified, curriculum in those classrooms were adapted to meet the children's needs. The teachers expressed a sense of empowerment as a consequence of the project.",771.0,PORTFOLIO ASSESSMENT - A KEY TO IDENTIFYING HIDDEN TALENTS AND EMPOWERING TEACHERS OF YOUNG-CHILDREN,1994.0
"TALENT BEYOND WORDS - UNVEILING SPATIAL, EXPRESSIVE, KINESTHETIC, AND MUSICAL TALENT IN YOUNG-CHILDREN   Talent Beyond Words was developed to identify and serve children with potential talent in the performing arts, especially dance and percussion music. Participants in the program included elementary-aged students attending two inner city schools. All pupils at targeted grade levels received instruction over several weeks in order to provide rich opportunities for dynamic assessment by teams of professional artists, arts educators, and specially trained teachers from participating sites. Students identified as a result of the audition processes took part in demanding after school curricula over the course of 3 years. The students' proficiency levels in their respective performing arts were impressive, as was the esteem they gained from teachers, classmates, parents, and from their own disciplined efforts.",772.0,"TALENT BEYOND WORDS - UNVEILING SPATIAL, EXPRESSIVE, KINESTHETIC, AND MUSICAL TALENT IN YOUNG-CHILDREN",1994.0
"APOGEE - EQUITY IN THE IDENTIFICATION OF GIFTED AND TALENTED STUDENTS   The Academic Programs for Gifted with Excellence and Equity (APOGEE) serves over 3,000 students in 30 schools in eight school districts. The program was designed to address equity in identification of gifted and talented. The top 25% of students in various categories, such as disadvantaged, minorities, underachievers, limited English speakers, and students with disabilities, are identified and placed in these APOGEE classes. The teachers receive a 45-hour graduate course to train them in implementing a talent development program based on a student-centered curriculum in which choices. group work, projects, and self-regulation are encouraged. Preliminary results indicate significant differences on a pre-post administration of the Cornell Critical Thinking Test and on the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory. The subgroups of the student population are proportionately represented in the program classes.",773.0,APOGEE - EQUITY IN THE IDENTIFICATION OF GIFTED AND TALENTED STUDENTS,1994.0

"PROMISES TO KEEP - THE STORY OF PROJECT-PROMISE   Project Promise, funded under the auspices of the Jacob K. Javits Gifted Students Education Act, was implemented in selected school districts in three states: Arkansas, Kansas, and Missouri. Each state modified the project to fit local needs. Designed to provide leadership opportunities to identified middle school students, especially those from low socioeconomic environments, Project Promise supplemented in-school curricular options with a home visitor. The home visitor's task was to serve as a liaison between students' families and the school. Their role, however, grew in importance as they assisted families in obtaining both social services and information about career and college opportunities. After providing a brief overview of the project, this report more fully explains the role of the home visitor, how school districts modified curriculum to suit student needs, and how the leadership activities affected students in the project.",775.0,PROMISES TO KEEP - THE STORY OF PROJECT-PROMISE,1994.0

SEM has been implemented in school districts worldwide, and extensive evaluations and research studies indicate the effectiveness of the model. In this article, a brief explanation of SEM is provided as a summary of the research conducted on this approach. The review of the research is subdivided into (a) the effectiveness of the model as perceived by key groups, (b) research related to creative productivity, (c) research relating to personal and social development, (d) the use of SEM with underserved populations, (e) research on self-efficacy, (f) the use of SEM as a curricular framework, (g) research relating to learning styles and curriculum compacting, and (h) longitudinal research on the SEM, Research suggests that the model is effective at serving high-ability students in a variety of educational settings and in schools that serve diverse ethnic and socioeconomic populations.",779.0,RESEARCH RELATED TO THE SCHOOLWIDE ENRICHMENT TRIAD MODEL,1994.0
"RELATIONSHIPS AMONG PRIVATE SPEECH AND CREATIVITY MEASUREMENTS OF YOUNG-CHILDREN   The purpose of this study was to examine relationships among thought processes represented in young children's private speech and creativity assessments of the same children. A secondary purpose was to study the role of affective private speech and its association with creativity measures. The sample was 42 preschool and kindergarten children on whom creativity measures were obtained using the Torrance Thinking Creatively in Action and Movement (TCAM) assessment instrument. Private speech was collected from the same children. Each private speech utterance was coded into one of five levels: (a) task irrelevant speech (T-1); (b) nonfacilitative, task relevant speech (T-2); (c) task relevant speech (T-3); (d) coping/reinforcing speech (T-4); and (e) solving speech (T-5). Statistical analysis revealed significant positive relationships among creativity measures, solving speech, and coping/reinforcing speech. Furthermore, coping and reinforcing private speech were consistently linked with high creativity measures, demonstrating that the affective domain may play a critical role in creative thinking.",780.0,RELATIONSHIPS AMONG PRIVATE SPEECH AND CREATIVITY MEASUREMENTS OF YOUNG-CHILDREN,1994.0
"ASSESSING ARTISTIC AND PROBLEM-SOLVING PERFORMANCE IN MINORITY AND NONMINORITY STUDENTS USING A NONTRADITIONAL MULTIDIMENSIONAL APPROACH   The persistent underrepresentation of ethnic minority students in gifted programs requires change. Because identification tools used for entry into gifted programs often are held responsible for minority underrepresentation, this study investigated several nontraditional assessments for their efficacy in identifying both minority and nonminority students. A sample of 433 sixth-grade students responded to a drawing task and to two problem-solving assessments. Peer and teacher nominations also were used in the identification process. Findings indicated that the assessments identified a proportionate number of minority and nonminority students with potential in art or problem solving. The study holds promise for a multidimensional approach and for specific nontraditional assessments as means of effectively identifying both minority and nonminority student talents in art and problem solving. The study also suggests directions for further research.",781.0,ASSESSING ARTISTIC AND PROBLEM-SOLVING PERFORMANCE IN MINORITY AND NONMINORITY STUDENTS USING A NONTRADITIONAL MULTIDIMENSIONAL APPROACH,1994.0
"CLASSROOM PEER RELATIONS OF CHILDREN PARTICIPATING IN A PULL-OUT ENRICHMENT PROGRAM   We compared the classroom peer relations of fourth, fifth, and sixth graders participating in a pull-out enrichment program (Creative Learning in a Unique Environment [CLUE]) with all other classmates. Data included peer sociometric assessments, evaluations of friendship relationships, and peer nominations as aggressors and as victims of aggression. Relative to other classmates, CLUE children (a) were evaluated by peers as having greater social acceptability and social competence, (b) demonstrated greater awareness of reciprocity in friendship relationships, and (c) were perceived less often as an aggressor or as a victim of aggression. These children did not have more friends or best friends than their peers, but they had more valued positions within the peer network. These findings suggest that a pull-out enrichment program can be associated with enhanced peer relations in the classroom, an effect not evident in the current research literature.",782.0,CLASSROOM PEER RELATIONS OF CHILDREN PARTICIPATING IN A PULL-OUT ENRICHMENT PROGRAM,1994.0

Perceptions of students and their families when the students were seniors in high school indicated that the program was successful in achieving its stated goals. The program was also perceived to have had a long-term positive impact on the cognitive, affective, and social development of most participating students and to have been a developmentally appropriate talent development experience. The findings suggest that the Purdue Three-Stage Model is an effective framework for elementary enrichment programs.
