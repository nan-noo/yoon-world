"THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A SELF-INSTRUCTIONAL CURRICULAR UNIT IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF ADVANCED LEVEL CONCEPTS IN ASTRONOMY   This study investigated the effects of a self-instructional curricular unit on the development of advanced concepts in astronomy. All Talent Pool students and other interested students in grades five through eight were provided with a series of interest development activities in astronomy. Follow-up discussions and interest assessment procedures identified ten students who expressed a desire to pursue further training in this content area. Students were provided with binoculars, telescopes, and a self-instructional unit that would allow them to carry out their work at home during the evening hours. Parent participation and involvement were encouraged. A questionnaire and astronomy skills assessment scale were administered at the beginning and the conclusion of each student's observational and data-gathering activities. Results indicated moderate to considerable amounts of growth in most of the specific skills that were targeted in the self-instructional unit. Increased interest in astronomy was expressed by most of the students and one-half of the group elected to pursue their own advanced level investigations in astronomical research. Parent evaluations were extremely positive, and even those students who did not elect to pursue advanced research expressed favorable attitudes about the experience including increased self-confidence, and the development of positive study skills.",1106.0,THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A SELF-INSTRUCTIONAL CURRICULAR UNIT IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF ADVANCED LEVEL CONCEPTS IN ASTRONOMY,1985.0
"FACILITATOR OF LEARNING - A MICRO-ETHNOGRAPHIC STUDY OF THE TEACHER OF THE GIFTED   This study uses an ethnographic design to discover the patterns of behavior in selected teachers of the gifted as they guided children's independent studies. The research developed in two major phases; phase one suggested hypotheses and properties which were revised, tested, and verified in the second phase. A theoretical model of the roles of the teacher of the gifted is presented and possible applications of the research are suggested.",1107.0,FACILITATOR OF LEARNING - A MICRO-ETHNOGRAPHIC STUDY OF THE TEACHER OF THE GIFTED,1985.0
"PREFERENCES OF GIFTED STUDENTS FOR SELECTED TEACHER CHARACTERISTICS   Gifted children in grades 7-9 (N = 98) judged the importance of selected teacher characteristics in personal-social, cognitive, and classroom management domains. Subjects were enrolled in a gifted program in a large junior high school in West Texas. Gifted children were found to prefer personal-social characteristics over cognitive or classroom management characteristics. Results were compared to findings of a similar study conducted in Israel in which cognitive characteristics were found to be most highly valued.",1108.0,PREFERENCES OF GIFTED STUDENTS FOR SELECTED TEACHER CHARACTERISTICS,1985.0
"GIFTED-CHILDREN AND OTHER SIBLINGS   This study examined sibling relationships within families where only one of two children had been labeled gifted. Twenty-seven pairs of labeled/unlabeled siblings completed a forced-choice questionnaire investigating the sibling relationship. Responses were analyzed according to label, sex, sibling position, and age gap. The area of competition was perceived differently by labeled and unlabeled siblings. Competition appeared to be beneficial to the self-image of labeled children, encouraging cooperation and communication. For unlabeled children competition had negative effects inhibiting cooperation and damaging the sibling relationship.Both labeled and unlabeled siblings perceived more friction if the gifted child was the oldest.",1109.0,GIFTED-CHILDREN AND OTHER SIBLINGS,1985.0
"EARLY IDENTIFICATION OF THE GIFTED AND TALENTED   Given the recognized importance of early identification of and educational intervention for the gifted and talented, the present study examined the predictive validity of the STAR (Screening Test for Academic Readiness) as well as decision-making accuracy that could be expected if the STAR were used as one screening tool in the identification process. For a sample of 74 students referred for assessment, 28 of whom were ultimately placed in gifted and talented programs and 46 of whom failed to qualify for special educational placement, the results of the regression analysis indicated that prekindergarten STAR scores significantly predicted WISC-R Verbal, Performance, and Full Scale IQ scores obtained several years later. From a decision-making standpoint, the results indicated that a 72% accuracy rate would have resulted had later placement of students been based upon prekindergarten STAR scores alone.",1110.0,EARLY IDENTIFICATION OF THE GIFTED AND TALENTED,1985.0
"THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LEARNING STYLE PREFERENCE AND PERSONALITY-VARIABLES - AN EXPLORATORY INVESTIGATION WITH GIFTED STUDENTS   The relationship between the Children's Personality Questionnaire (CPQ) and the Your Style of Learning and Thinking (SOLAT) was examined for 94 intellectually gifted students aged 9 to 14 years. Groups formed based on SOLAT scores were: (a) Right, (b) Left, (c) Integrated, and (d) Mixed. Discriminant functions derived from all CPQ factors yielded three functions. One discriminant function which can be described as an action dimension was significant. A classification analysis yielded 61.7% correct classification. These results indicate that there is a relationship between personality variables and preference for a particular style of information processing.",1111.0,THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LEARNING STYLE PREFERENCE AND PERSONALITY-VARIABLES - AN EXPLORATORY INVESTIGATION WITH GIFTED STUDENTS,1985.0
"THE PERFORMANCE OF STUDENTS IN A PROGRAM OF RADICAL ACCELERATION AT THE UNIVERSITY LEVEL   The academic performance of 24 academically accelerated students (mean age at matriculation = 14 years) was compared with that of two groups of college students averaging four years older: 24 matched to the accelerants on pre-entry academic aptitude test scores (or ""readiness""), and 24 National Merit Scholars. Accelerated students earned cumulative grade point averages comparable to those earned by National Merit Scholars and significantly higher than those earned by university students matched on pre-entry aptitude tests scores. Accelerated students rated the importance of academic characteristics higher than did the students matched on pre-entry scores and they were more satisfied with the academic environment of the university than either comparison group. Implications of the results are briefly discussed.",1112.0,THE PERFORMANCE OF STUDENTS IN A PROGRAM OF RADICAL ACCELERATION AT THE UNIVERSITY LEVEL,1985.0

"MAXIMIZING WHAT GIFTED STUDENTS CAN LEARN - RECENT FINDINGS OF LEARNING-STRATEGY RESEARCH   Recent findings suggest that gifted learners spontaneously employ more elaborate and effective learning strategies than do their age peers. When presented with externally provided learning strategies, however, the learning of gifted students can dramatically increase. Of particular interest is the ""keyword"" mnemonic strategy which has recently been seen to provide substantial increases in learning for gifted learners.

"GIFTEDNESS AND READING - A CROSS-SECTIONAL VIEW OF DIFFERENCES IN READING ATTITUDES AND BEHAVIORS   This study investigated the attitude toward reading and the self-reported reading behaviors of 276 gifted students in grades 1 through 12. Females had more positive attitudes toward reading and reported that reading was a hobby more frequently than males. Primary students had more positive attitudes toward reading than did senior high students. Primary students reported reading more books per month than intermediate level, junior high school, and senior high school students. Senior high school students reported reading the least number of books per month.",1115.0,GIFTEDNESS AND READING - A CROSS-SECTIONAL VIEW OF DIFFERENCES IN READING ATTITUDES AND BEHAVIORS,1985.0
"GIFTEDNESS AND TALENT - REEXAMINING A REEXAMINATION OF THE DEFINITIONS   In the scientific literature, there is ambiguity in the distinction between the concepts of giftedness and talent. This paper examines several common definitions of these two terms, with particular emphasis on the models proposed by Renzulli (1979) and Cohn (1981). Our critique of these two models leads to a clear differentiation between giftedness and talent: the former is associated with domains of abilities which foster and explain exceptional performance in varied fields of activities, that is, talents. Thus, one can be gifted without necessarily being talented (as with the case of underachievers), but not vice versa. Several factors which can act as catalysts for the actualization of giftedness in specific talents are discussed, particularly motivation and environmental quality.",1116.0,GIFTEDNESS AND TALENT - REEXAMINING A REEXAMINATION OF THE DEFINITIONS,1985.0
"PSYCHOMETRIC LIMITATIONS OF GUILFORD STRUCTURE-OF-INTELLECT MODEL FOR IDENTIFICATION AND PROGRAMMING OF THE GIFTED   The purpose of this presentation is (a) to analyze critically reseach and promotional literature on Guilford's Structure-of-Intellect (SOI) model as it relates to the cognitive functioning of gifted students, and (b) to evaluate the implications of this analysis for the identification and programming of gifted students. This evaluation is based on a review of promotional literature and available research, and is written from a measurement basis. It is concluded that the promotional literature promises more than it has delivered and that major psychometric limitations seriously limit the SOI model's usefulness.",1117.0,PSYCHOMETRIC LIMITATIONS OF GUILFORD STRUCTURE-OF-INTELLECT MODEL FOR IDENTIFICATION AND PROGRAMMING OF THE GIFTED,1985.0

"DIMENSIONS OF ANXIETY AMONG HIGH IQ CHILDREN   Responses of 584 high IQ children to the 37 item Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale were submitted to a factor analysis. The five factors that emerged (Physiological, Worry/Oversensitivity, Concentration, Lie 1, and Lie 2) were shown to be highly similar to the factors found with the normative sample. Coefficients of congruence revealed significant correspondence between all factors for the high IQ and normative group. Means and standard deviations for males and females at each age group are also reported, revealing lower levels of anxiety for the high IQ group on all variables. Reliability estimates for each age group on the three subscales of anxiety and for the total Anxiety Scale support the clinical and research use of this new scale in work with high IQ children.",1119.0,DIMENSIONS OF ANXIETY AMONG HIGH IQ CHILDREN,1985.0
"THE EFFECT OF APTITUDE AND ACHIEVEMENT STATUS ON THE SELF-SYSTEM   This investigation examined the independent and joint effects of aptitude (gifted vs. normal) and achievement (underachiever vs. achiever) on assessments of the self-system in upper elementary-aged children. The gifted group was significantly higher than the average group on self-evaluations of competence, feelings of mastery, and preference for independent decision making. The average group reported a lower level of understanding than the gifted group about the reasons for success and failure outcomes and more anxiety about school-related events. Underachievers were significantly lower than achievers on self-evaluations of performance and higher on perceptions of internal control over success and failure outcomes. Achievers were higher on perceptions of control by powerful others over outcomes.",1120.0,THE EFFECT OF APTITUDE AND ACHIEVEMENT STATUS ON THE SELF-SYSTEM,1985.0

"GIFTS OF MENTORSHIPS   The benefits or ""gifts"" deriving from a mentorship, for both mentors and proteges, are described. The list of benefits was developed from the literature on mentorships, from interviews with mentors and proteges, and from an evaluation completed by gifted students and their mentors at the termination of a school mentorship program. Gifts to proteges include: advancement of career, an increase in knowledge and skills (general as well as specific), development of known as well as undiscovered talents, development of a personal ethic, establishment of a friendship, and enhancement of creativity. Also described are the following gifts to mentors: getting work done, having ideation stimulated, establishing a long-term friendship, and receiving personal satisfaction.

"A CHILD BY ANY OTHER NAME - A COMPARISON OF THE PLAYFULNESS OF GIFTED AND NONGIFTED CHILDREN   Fifteen preschool children, designated gifted by standard intelligence testing procedures, were matched with a nongifted preschool sample. The children were observed and rated on the degree of composite playfulness they established as well as on five constituent play dimensions. Results indicated the gifted children demonstrated higher degrees of physical, social, and cognitive play styles but were equivalent to the nongifted group in sense of humor and manifest joy. Significant sex differences were also obtained, with boys demonstrating more physical exuberance, active play patterns, teasing and joking during play, and less variety. Findings were discussed as they reflect on developmental changes through childhood and point to accelerated distributions for gifted children.",1125.0,A CHILD BY ANY OTHER NAME - A COMPARISON OF THE PLAYFULNESS OF GIFTED AND NONGIFTED CHILDREN,1985.0
"ETHNOGRAPHY OF A PRESCHOOL FOR THE GIFTED - WHAT GIFTED YOUNG-CHILDREN ACTUALLY DO   An analysis of naturalistic observations of children attending a preschool for the gifted suggests that young gifted children behave in a manner similar to unselected preschool children. However, gifted preschoolers frequently demonstrate advanced knowledge, thinking abilities, creativity, and social maturity. Other observed behaviors include competitiveness, independence, and persistence in task completion. These descriptions of young gifted children as a group should be tempered by the finding that many individual differences exist. The results of this study suggest several implications for preschool programs for the gifted.",1126.0,ETHNOGRAPHY OF A PRESCHOOL FOR THE GIFTED - WHAT GIFTED YOUNG-CHILDREN ACTUALLY DO,1985.0

Group administrations were conducted in two schools differing in the probable socioeconomic status (SES) of their pupils. Scores increased with grade level and were greater in the higher SES school, though the latter difference accounted for a much smaller proportion of the variance.

"SELF-CONCEPT, SELF-ESTEEM, AND PEER RELATIONS AMONG GIFTED-CHILDREN WHO FEEL DIFFERENT   Two-hundred seventy-one elementary age high-IQ children and their parents completed an extensive battery of questions on social and emotional development. Eighty-eight children (37%) conceptualized themselves as differing from their peers. Although they described differences in a positive fashion, and although their self-esteem was above the mean reported for a large normative sample, it was lower than that of high-IQ children who did not think of themselves as being different. Furthermore, the reports about peer relations given by children who thought themselves different contained more signs suggesting difficulties than did those of children who did not. These results suggest that many cognitively gifted children need increased psychological support if they are to optimize their personal and social development.",1129.0,"SELF-CONCEPT, SELF-ESTEEM, AND PEER RELATIONS AMONG GIFTED-CHILDREN WHO FEEL DIFFERENT",1985.0

They maintain that evaluation of gifted programs should be formative, as opposed to summative, because gifted programming serves a valuable social need. The authors describe the process that evaluators go through to conduct a program evaluation, and then present their program evaluation model. Two approaches are integrated in their model. First, process-oriented evaluation defines essential program components and standards of acceptance. Second, outcome-oriented evaluation assesses components via student outcomes.

"ATTRIBUTES OF EXCELLENCE IN VARIOUS PROFESSIONS - THEIR RELEVANCE TO THE SELECTION OF GIFTED TALENTED PERSONS   Grades will predict grades and the academic-type tests will predict grades but they have been found through research studies to be poor predictors or no predictors at all of who will be the best in professions. The troublesome answer generally is that professional schools do not select the persons who will become the best professionals in their fields, nor who will best keep up-to-date with new knowledge and techniques in their careers. The main exception to this general finding occurs in the field of professional athletics and in the entertainment and artistic fields. The example given comes from the Dallas Cowboys scouting data and outcome of potential football recruits in their professional careers. Their correlations are about .70 with career success, whereas predictors from professional schools range from zeros to about +.20 or slightly higher—such predictors from professional schools still miss over 90% or even over 95% of the target, i.e., what is involved in succeeding in each of the professions.
