"Factors influencing the development of perfectionism in gifted college students   This study is part of a larger research investigation of perfectionism in gifted college students. Employing a qualitative interview design, this study examined factors comntributing to the development of two dimensions of perfectionism, socially prescribed and self-orientated, in gifted college students. Findings indicated that exposure to parental perfectionism and an authoritarian parenting style led to the perception of stringent expectations, self-worth tied to achievement, and a fear of disappointing others, which collectively influenced the development of socially prescribed perfectionism. Factors contributing to the development of self-oriented perfection included mastery of early academic experiences without effort, no previous experience with academic failure, and modeling of parental perfectionism. Implications for future research and recommendations for parents and educators of gifted children are suggested.",425.0,Factors influencing the development of perfectionism in gifted college students,2004.0
"Parenting styles and mental health of Arab gifted adolescents   This study examined the parental styles and psychosocial adjustment of adolescents and the relationship between them in gifted as compared to non-gifted Arab adolescents. Five scales-The parental Authority Questionnaire. Child Attitude Toward Parents, Lipsitt's Self-Concept Scale for Children, Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale, and the Psychological State Scale-were administered to 118 gifted and 115 nongifted Arab adolescents in Isreal. Results indicate that parents of gifted adolescents tend to be more authoritarive and less authoritarian then parents of nongifted adolescents. The attitudes of the gifted adolescents their parents were more positive than those of the nongifted adolescents. The gifted displayed higher self-esteem and fewer identity disorders, phobias, and conduct disorders than the nongifted adolescents. The authoritative parental style correlates positively with the mental health of both gifted and nongifted adolescents, while the authoritarian parenting impacts negatively on the mental health of the gifted, but not of the nongifted adolescents. The study results indicate that the authoritarian parenting style is a crucial factor that influences the well-being of gifted children and may affect their psychological adjustment. More studies are needed among gifted underachievers and among eminent Arab writers and artists.",426.0,Parenting styles and mental health of Arab gifted adolescents,2004.0
"Reliability and validity of learning behaviors scale (LBS) scores with academically talented students: A comparative perspective   In this study, teacher ratings of academically talented (AT) students on the Learning Behaviours Scale (LBS) were examined for evidence of reliability and validity in two cohorts attending a summer program. The LBS is a 29-item rating scale assessing learning behaviours related to academic success. Cohort 1 consisted of 387 students and cohort 2 consisted 287 students. The AT students , scores were similar to scores of gifted and talented and high-IQ students in the normative sample, and reliability estimates of participants' scores were in the moderate to high range. The scores resulted in factors that were similar to those found in the normative sample. and coefficients of congruence were greater than .85 for two LBS factors across samples. LBS scores predicted achievement after controlling for previous achievement and socioeconomic status. Future research should examine LBS scores in public school settings with identified and referred students.",427.0,Reliability and validity of learning behaviors scale (LBS) scores with academically talented students: A comparative perspective,2004.0
"The case law on gifted education: A new look   To fill a gap in the literature, this article provides a comprehensive, concise, and current overview of the case law-specifically, published hearing/review officer and court decisions-concerning gifted education for K-12 students. This case law represents two distinct groups: gifted-alone, designating students whose legal status is based solely on their gifted status, and gifted plus, designating students who not only are gifted, but also have special legal status typically in terms of disability (i.e., twice exceptional'') or race. The outcomes of the case law in both categories have generally favored the defendant school districts. The abscence in many states of strong and specific legislation or regulations for gifted-alone students and the lack of judicial sensitivity to the complexity of the gifted-plus category likely contribute to the overall district-friendly trend of the case law to date.",428.0,The case law on gifted education: A new look,2004.0
"Reading instruction for talented readers: Case studies documenting few opportunities for continuous progress   In this study, a team of researchers conducted multiple observations in 12 third-and seventh grade reading classrooms in both urban and suburban school districts over a 9-month period. These observations focused on whether talented readers received differentiated reading curriculum and/or instructional strategies. Talented readers were defined as students reading at least two grades above their chronological grade placement who also had advanced language skills and advanced processing capabilities in reading. Results indicated that talented readers received some differentiated reading instruction. Appropriately challenging books were seldom made available for talented students in their classrooms, and they were rarley provided with more challenging work. Different patterns did emerge across districts. For example, the three classroom teachers who did provide some level of differentiation all taught in suburban schools.",429.0,Reading instruction for talented readers: Case studies documenting few opportunities for continuous progress,2004.0
"An instrument for the measure of Dabrowskian overexcitabilities to identify gifted elementary students   The ElemenOE is a likert-scaled observation checklist developed in this study to measure 5 personality charachteristics in elementary school children , with predictive validity for identifying giftedness. The characteristics, named overexcitables, are described within the context of Dabrowski's Theory of Positive Disintegration. Five scholars of Dabrowski's theory rated an initial 100 items for content validity. The 61 strongest items comprised the pilot instrument, which teachers used to describe 373 students. Exploratory factor analysis using varimax rotation found factors that related to 5 OEs. Items with loadings of less than .5 were eliminated, thus creating the 30-item ElemenOE. Teachers used the ElemenOE to describe 171 gifted and nonidentical children. A discriminant analysis yielded one function that significantly discriminated between groups. The ElemenOE classified 76% of gifted students and 42% of nonidentified students as having similar OE profiles. These results indicate that, with revisions, the elementOE may be useful in identifying gifted students who are missed by traditional identification measures.",430.0,An instrument for the measure of Dabrowskian overexcitabilities to identify gifted elementary students,2004.0

"Social self-concept, social attributions, and peer relationships in fourth, fifth, and sixth graders who are gifted compared to high achievers   Socially related self-concept attributions for social success and failure, and peer relationships were investigated for fourth through sixth graders identified as intellectually gifted and a comparison group of high achievers not identified as gifted. The group identified as gifted scored significantly on 3 of 4 socially related self-concept subscales (p < .01) and on the general self-concept scale (p < .05) of the Self-Description Questionnaire-I (March, 1998). On the Student Social Attribution Scale (Bell & McCallum, 1995), an interaction effect was noted, with the group identified as gifted scoring higher than the comparison group on attributions for social success due to ability and effort and lower on attributions for social failure due to ability, effort, and task difficulty. Though teachers' ratings of peer relationships yielded no differences between the 2 groups, boys across groups were rated significantly higher than girls (p < .05).",432.0,"Social self-concept, social attributions, and peer relationships in fourth, fifth, and sixth graders who are gifted compared to high achievers",2004.0
"A comparative study of creativity and cognitive problem-solving strategies of high-IQ and average students   This study assessed the creative thinking abilities of high-IQ and average students on fluency, flexibility, originality and elaboration. Seventeen high-IQ fifth and sixth graders and 20 average fifth and sixth graders were given 4 batteries of Torrance's Verbal and Figural Tests (A and B) as pretests and posttests and three Future Problem Solving tasks to assess their creative thinking and problem-solving skills. A significant interaction between performance, and IQ over time was demonstrated for verbal fluency. The high-IQ students scored low and finished higher over time. The average students scored high on the pretest, but dropped over time. The interaction for figural elaboration indicated little difference between the groups at pretest, but there was an increase for the average students, and a decrease for the high-IQ students at posttest. Variability in performances of both high-IQ students and average students suggests the need for training in creative thinking skills.",433.0,A comparative study of creativity and cognitive problem-solving strategies of high-IQ and average students,2004.0
"Cognitive and motivational characteristics of adolescents gifted in mathematics: Comparisons among students with different types of giftedness   Although numerous studies have compared cognitive and motivational characteristics between gifted versus nongifted students, research comparing those characteristics among different types of gifted students has not kept up with the theoretical development that saw a transition from unidimensional to multidimensional conceptualizations of giftedness. This study compares cognitive and motivational characteristics of high school students who are academically gifted in math, creatively talented in math, and nongifted. Whereas no differences between were found among the three groups in their beliefs about ability, most of the other characteristics examined in the study distinguished the three groups. Academically gifted female students reported expending more effort than did academically gifted male students. Creatively talented males put forth more effort than academically gifted males, and the creatively talented in general used more cognitive strategies than the academically gifted. Overall, students who were either academically gifted or creatively talented in mathematics perceived that they were self-efficacious in general, used cognitive strategies, perceived their math ability and math self-efficacy to be high, and valued learning math more so than their nongifted age peers.",434.0,Cognitive and motivational characteristics of adolescents gifted in mathematics: Comparisons among students with different types of giftedness,2004.0
"Applicability of the test of creative thinking-drawing production for assessing creative potential of Hong Kong adolescents   This study explored the applicability of the Test of Creative Thinking Drawing Production (TCT-DP), in the Hong Kong Chinese cultural context. The psychometric properties of scores on the TCT-DP were examined on a sample story of 2,368 Hong Kong Chinese students aged 12 to 16. The study compared with TCT-DP's internal consistency, interrater and test-retest reliability coefficients for the Hong Kong sample to previously reported findings for European samples. Structural, concurrent and discriminant validity of the test scores were evaluated. Our data provided encouraging empirical evidence for the reliability and structural discriminant validity of the TCT-DP. The psychometric properties of the test were comparable to those obtained for European samples. However, the sexy low stability of Humor and Unconventionality b scales is of some concern. No sex differences were observed with regard to test scores.",435.0,Applicability of the test of creative thinking-drawing production for assessing creative potential of Hong Kong adolescents,2004.0
"Understanding the relationship between perfectionism and achievement motivation in gifted college students   This study is a slice of an overarching research investigation of perfectionism in gifted college students. Utilizing a qualitative interview design, this study examined how gifted college students scoring high on 1 or 2 different dimensions of perfectionism (socially prescribed or self-oriented) perceived their achievement motivation. Findings indicated that for the socially prescribed perfectionists, an underlying motive to avoid failure influenced their achievement goals and behaviors. Based on this motive, they set both performance avoidance and performance-approach goals and tended toward procrastination in their work. In contrast, an underlying motive to achieve influenced the achievement goals and behaviors of the self-oriented perfectionists. These participants set both mastery and performance approach goals. They developed a strong work ethic, and they were motivated to seek out challenges. Implications of these findings are suggested, and recommendations for parents and educators working with gifted perfectionist students are discussed.",436.0,Understanding the relationship between perfectionism and achievement motivation in gifted college students,2004.0
"Multicultural mentoring to increase black male representation in gifted programs   This article explores factors that affect the decision of gifted Black males to participate in gifted programs. Ford (1996) maintains that Black students often choose not to participate in gifted programs, and this choice contributes to their underrepresentation in gifted education. This choice to not participate in gifted programs is often based on social or external influences, particularly negative peer pressures, as well as internal or psychological issues, namely racial identity status. Given this perspective, a participation motivation model, developed by the author, is described along with a discussion of how racial identity influences the choices Black males make about participating in gifted programs. While many options exist for helping these students to make constructive and long-term decisions, this article concentrates on the potentially powerful influence of mentorships as a viable retention strategy.",437.0,Multicultural mentoring to increase black male representation in gifted programs,2004.0

"A case study of a child with dyslexia and spatial-temporal gifts   This case study details the history and K-5 school experience of a boy with dyslexia and spatial-temporal gifts. It describes assessment, evaluation, and identification procedures; the learning specialist's interventions and program; the critical role of the parent; and the services provided by the gifted program. Specific interventions are described for both remediating dyslexia and supporting the spatial-temporal gift. A literature review of dual exceptionalities is included and suggests that mathematical difficulties be included in the definition of dyslexia. A definition of spatial-temporal intelligence provides an understanding of 4-dimensional space-time.",440.0,A case study of a child with dyslexia and spatial-temporal gifts,2004.0
"An empirical typology of perfectionism in gifted adolescents   We document a typology of perfectionism in a sample of academically talented adolescents and directly examine its relationship to indices of psychiatric symptomatology, adjustment, self-esteem, and coping. Adolescents enrolled in a state-funded residential academy for academically gifted high school students (N = 141) responded. to the Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale (Frost, Marten, Lahart, & Rosenblate, 1990), the Hopkins Symptom Checklist, the Mastery Coping and Superior Adjustment scales from the Self-Image Questionnaire for Young Adolescents, the Perception of Personal Security and Academic Competence scales from the Self-Esteem Index, and the Coping Inventory (COPE). A 2-step cluster analysis of perfectionism scores revealed four clusters: Mixed-Adaptive (n = 51), Mixed-Maladaptive (n = 20), Pervasive (n = 30), and Self-Assured Nonperfectionist (n = 39). The Pervasive and Mixed-Maladaptive clusters showed a uniformly poor profile of mental health, adjustment, and coping relative to Mixed-Adaptive and Nonperfectionists. The Mixed-Adaptive cluster reported greater academic competence and superior adjustment than did the Nonperfectionist cluster, although these cluster groups were statistically similar on other dimensions of mental health and adjustment. These results suggest that maladaptive perfectionism takes two forms: pervasive and mixed. Implications for intervention and directions for future research are discussed.",441.0,An empirical typology of perfectionism in gifted adolescents,2004.0
"An illustrative case study of precocious reading ability   This is a longitudinal case study of a child who taught herself to read before she went to school. This case study is drawn from a wider study of a group of precocious readers, all of whom had received no explicit instruction, but who had had positive literacy experiences in their homes. The subject of this study was able to read fluently at the age of 5 years and 4 months. Her reading was at least 5 years ahead of her chronological age and her spelling was 4 years ahead. Her reading speed was also very proficient. Moreover, tests indicated that her pseudoword reading was highly accurate and that she was highly proficient on a series of measures of phonemic awareness. Her performance was also assessed at the ages of 6, 7, and 11 years. She continued to show high levels of ability in all aspects of literacy. This study contrasts with recent case studies on very precocious readers who showed poor levels of phonological awareness and who were unable to spell at an early age.",442.0,An illustrative case study of precocious reading ability,2004.0
"Toward the development of a ceonceptualization of gifted motivation   Whereas perspectives on giftedness have included motivation as a construct related to giftedness, the proposed conceptualization advances a new view that motivation is an area of giftedness in and of itself. Academic intrinsic motivation (i.e., enjoyment of school learning) is the domain focused upon in this conceptuahzation inasmuch as it has inherent ties to cognition, gifted intellect, and achievement. Research supports the following criteria, advanced as a beginning effort toward the development of a conceptualization of a gifted motivation construct: (a) significantly higher academic intrinsic motivation is evidenced by intellectually gifted compared to their comparison cohort; (b) academic intrinsic motivation is significantly, positively, and uniquely related to academic achievement above and beyond IQ; (c) academic intrinsic motivation evidences substantial continuity from childhood through adolescence; and (d) environment is significantly related to academic intrinsic motivation. The construct of gifted motivation serves heuristic purposes to advance further inquiry and also has implications regarding the development and implementation of giftedness programs. Suggestions are made regarding research needed for further development of a gifted motivation construct.",443.0,Toward the development of a ceonceptualization of gifted motivation,2004.0
"The relationship between scores on the ICMIC and selected talent domains: An investigation with gifted adolescents   This investigation compared fantasy-proneness levels and IQ scores in gifted adolescents with primary talent areas in 1 of 4 domains: mathematics, computer science, creative writing, and chemistry. The Inventory of Childhood Memories and Imaginings: Children's Form (ICMIC; Myers, 1983) was used to assess fantasy-proneness. IQ scores were generated through the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test (K-BIT; Kaufman & Kaufman, 1990). The mean ICMIC score of the creative writing group was found to be statistically significantly higher than that of any of the other 3 groups. Across all groups, those ranking highest in fantasy-prone characteristics also scored highest in measured IQ.",444.0,The relationship between scores on the ICMIC and selected talent domains: An investigation with gifted adolescents,2004.0

"Gifted students' perceptions of the academic and social/emotional effects of homogeneous and heterogeneous grouping   This study investigated student perceptions of differences in academic and social effects that occur when gifted and talented youth are grouped homogeneously (i.e., in special classes for gifted students) as contrasted with heterogeneously (i.e., in classes with many ability levels represented). Forty-four students in grades 5-11 completed interviews or questionnaires while attending a summer residential program for gifted and talented students. Questions were designed to clarify the nature of academic and social outcomes under the two grouping conditions. On the whole, the participants perceived homogenous grouping more positively with respect to academic outcomes. They learned more in the more challenging environment provided by homogenous classes. However, they had mixed feelings about which setting better met their social needs. Participants seemed to value having both similar peers in homogeneous classes. A troubling finding that emerged was the preference of a few of the students for heterogenous classes because they were easier and enabled them to attain a high class ranking with little work. Implications of the findings for educators and counselors of gifted students are discussed.",448.0,Gifted students' perceptions of the academic and social/emotional effects of homogeneous and heterogeneous grouping,2004.0
"Exploring teacher biases when nominating students for gifted programs   The purpose of this study was to identify student characteristics that might influence teachers in referring students for gifted programs. We developed a series of 12 student profiles to measure teacher bias and asked teachers to indicate how strongly they believed the students in the profiles should or should not be recommended for their district gifted program. We found the ability to do mental computations over-shadowed completion of schoolwork, and the esoteric nature of student interest appeared to be equivalent to completion of schoolwork. We found that completing schoolwork was not a factor when students possessed a large storehouse of information. We also learned that classroom teachers may be more inclined than gifted specialists to focus on student weaknesses, rather than student strengths.",449.0,Exploring teacher biases when nominating students for gifted programs,2004.0
"Social coping and psychological distress among Chinese gifted students in Hong Kong   This study explored the relationship between social coping and psychological distress in a sample of chinese students in Hong Kong. These students, nominated by their schools to join university gifted programs, were assessed with respect to their nonverbal IQ (nonverbal resoning), social coping strategies in response to being gifted, and psychological distress in 5 specific symptom areas. The findings indicated that gender age, and nonverbal IQ had notable effects on specific social coping strategies. Students' coping by valuing peer acceptance and coping by attempting avoidance emerged as 2 of the most important social coping strategies predicting specific psychological symptoms. The implications of the findings for preventive interventions to help gifted students in their promotion and maintenance of psychological well-being are discussed.",450.0,Social coping and psychological distress among Chinese gifted students in Hong Kong,2004.0
"Korean teachers' attitudes toward academic brilliance   This is a replication of a study designed by Tannenbaum (1962) and repeated by Cramond and Martin (1987) measuring U.S. attitudes toward intelligence by having respondents rate 8 hypothetical students who varied in their combinations of athleticism, effort, and academic ability. This study investigated 132 Korean preservice and in-service teachers' attitudes on the same measure. Both Korean teacher groups favored athleticism and nonstudiousness over academic brilliance and showed a gender bias by designating their preferred characters as boys more often. The least favored character was the academically brilliant, studious, nonathletic student often considered traditionally gifted and usually designated as a girl. The anti-intellectualism, sport mindedness, and gender bias in the present study's Korean participants was similar to that found in American samples. These results suggest a need for better teacher training and understanding of gifted students. This study is important because it reminds us of future and current teachers' views of gifted students, especially in Korea, where gifted education is now being initiated. Also, it demonstrates the ubiquitous nature of anti-intellectualism, even in a country considered to value academics.",451.0,Korean teachers' attitudes toward academic brilliance,2004.0
