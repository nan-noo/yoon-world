"BUILDING ADVOCACY THROUGH PROGRAM DESIGN, STUDENT PRODUCTIVITY AND PUBLIC-RELATIONS   Building advocacy for programs serving high ability students should be a priority for all persons working in these programs. In this article, the process of building advocacy through the program itself, the superior products of participating students, and the continued commitment to public relations is introduced. Factors common to programs that have survived the current economic crisis in New England, including sustained advocacy efforts, are also discussed.",863.0,"BUILDING ADVOCACY THROUGH PROGRAM DESIGN, STUDENT PRODUCTIVITY AND PUBLIC-RELATIONS",1991.0
"DISSEMINATION BY DESIGN - A TOOL FOR ADVANCING GIFTED EDUCATION   This article presents an effective advocacy model which has been operating successfully in the state of Wisconsin for 3 years. Advocates, even in a state with meager or threatened resources, can strengthen their leadership force through ongoing collaboration and dissemination. Essential elements of the dissemination design are: establishment of regional sites, team requirements for participation, small- and large-group sharing and problem solving, and the preparation and presentation of exemplary practices. With these elements working by design, the model leads to advocacy that is consistent, constant, accessible, and visible. Although advocacy is never ending, bringing the right people together at the right time and in the right environment is a powerful tool for advancing gifted education.",864.0,DISSEMINATION BY DESIGN - A TOOL FOR ADVANCING GIFTED EDUCATION,1991.0
"GIFTED EDUCATION WITHOUT A STATE MANDATE - THE IMPORTANCE OF VIGOROUS ADVOCACY   Almost half of the states have mandates requiring differentiated instruction for gifted students. New York State, despite the lack of a mandate, has seen an increase in services for gifted students over the last 10 years. Factors that have promoted the development of programs for gifted students in the state are financial incentives, mandatory screening for giftedness, educational reform, and vigorous advocacy. Negative factors associated with the lack of a mandate have been inequities in access to programs, difficulties in assuring the quality of programs, and limited access to teacher preparation programs.",865.0,GIFTED EDUCATION WITHOUT A STATE MANDATE - THE IMPORTANCE OF VIGOROUS ADVOCACY,1991.0
"EDUCATIONAL PARTNERSHIPS - GIFTED PROGRAM ADVOCACY IN ACTION   As advocates for gifted programs, professionals in gifted child education and special education must work closely with school reform efforts to ensure that appropriate representation and service to gifted pupils are embedded within the reform framework. They should examine the development of partnerships and assess the strengths and weaknesses of collaboratives. They also should conduct research to strengthen the development of such efforts. This article discusses the critical elements of educational partnerships and presents an example of a partnership project designed to enhance educational opportunities for gifted children in an urban school setting.",866.0,EDUCATIONAL PARTNERSHIPS - GIFTED PROGRAM ADVOCACY IN ACTION,1991.0

"A COMPARISON OF INTELLECTUALLY SUPERIOR PRESCHOOL ACCELERATED READERS AND NONREADERS - 4 YEARS LATER   This study examined the reading/written language abilities of a group of intellectually superior eight- and nine-year-old students who had been identified as Accelerated Readers and Nonreaders at the age of four years. All subjects had previously participated in a study that examined specific factors in a supportive home environment related to the early development of accelerated reading abilities. During the origmaistudy, all Accelerated Readers read at a mid-first- to fifth-grade level; verbally produced vowel and consonant sounds when shown corresponding letters, and performed well when involved in inventive spelling activities. Nonreaders read no words and exhibited limited knowledge of letter-sound correspondences. When retested at the age of eight and nine years, the Accelerated Readers scored significantly higher than the Nonreaders on subtests measuring word attack and dictation: However, no significant differences were found on subtests measuring word recognition or comprehension. A review of school based data indicated that the majority of the subjects in the two groups had been provided the same type of basal reading instruction upon entry into elementary school despite significant differences in their reading capabilities at the age of four years.",869.0,A COMPARISON OF INTELLECTUALLY SUPERIOR PRESCHOOL ACCELERATED READERS AND NONREADERS - 4 YEARS LATER,1991.0
"GIFTED AVERAGE READERS - DO THEY USE THE SAME READING STRATEGIES   The purpose of this research was to compare the reading processing strategies of gifted readers with those of average readers. A random sampling, stratified by sex and grade level, was taken from a population of 300 eighth-, tenth-, and twelfth-grade students. Subjects included 30 females and 30 males. Fourteen reading processing strategies were identified using think-aloud protocols as a measuring instrument. The strategies used significantly more by gifted than by average readers were rereading, inferring, anatyzing structure, watching or predicting, evaluating, and relating to content area. The strategies used significantly more by average than by gifted readers were word pronouncing concern and summarizing inaccurately.",870.0,GIFTED AVERAGE READERS - DO THEY USE THE SAME READING STRATEGIES,1991.0

"PERSONALITY GROWTH OF FEMALE EARLY COLLEGE ENTRANTS - A CONTROLLED, PROSPECTIVE-STUDY   Many educators fear that early college entrance may be too stressful for young adolescents and therefore deleterious to healthy personality development. Advocates of acceleration point out the absence of research support for such concerns. In fact, the available evidence is not conclusive because previous studies: (a) often fail to use standard, well-validated personality measures; and/or (b) do not examine student adjustment both before and after a period of acceleration. The present study examined the adjustment of 33 female accelerants by administering the California Psychological Inventory at the beginning and end of their first academic year in a residential early college entrance program. Accelerants evidenced a surprisingly consistent pattern of healthy personality growth over the course of the year. Similar growth was not observed in a control group of capable nonacceferants attending traditional high schools.",872.0,"PERSONALITY GROWTH OF FEMALE EARLY COLLEGE ENTRANTS - A CONTROLLED, PROSPECTIVE-STUDY",1991.0

"SOCIOEMOTIONAL ADJUSTMENT OF ADOLESCENT GIRLS ENROLLED IN A RESIDENTIAL ACCELERATION PROGRAM   This prospective study of adolescent girls enrolled in a residential early college entrance program investigated whether socioemotional adjustment could be predicted by prior personality and family characteristics. Adjustment was assessed from staff, student, and peer perspectives over the course of one academic year. Results indicate consistent predictive relationships between the Jackson Personality Inventory, the Self-Perception Profile for Adolescents, the Family Environment Scale, the Parent Adolescent Communication Scale, and four outcome adjustment measures.

"UNDERREPRESENTATION OF MINORITY-STUDENTS IN GIFTED PROGRAMS - YES - IT MATTERS   The underrepresentation of minority students in programs for the gifted has been a source of concern for many years. Most recently, Van Tassel-Baska, Patton,- and Prillaman (1989) in a national survey found ""... a clear underrepresentation of minority students, particularly Blacks, in gifted programs at the K-12 level ...."" Because there are so few studies dealing with the absolute efficacy of gifted programming in general, it is not surprising that fewer studies assess the impact of gifted programming on minority students. This paper combines data from two midwest cities to suggest that gifted programming has an impact on drop-out rates and college enrollment. The data presented make it clear that minority students benefit from gifted programs and that their continuing underrepresentation in such programs is indefensible.",881.0,UNDERREPRESENTATION OF MINORITY-STUDENTS IN GIFTED PROGRAMS - YES - IT MATTERS,1991.0

"GIFTEDNESS AND FLEXIBILITY ON A MATHEMATICAL SET-BREAKING TASK   Accuracy, speed, flexibility, and metacognitive knowledge were studied in 19 school-identified gifted and 11 average ability 11-year-old students. The most intet-esting result was a significant three-way interaction among giftedness, speed, and flexibility, with metacognitive knowledge as the criterion. Regardless of speed, rigid (inflexible) gifted children had less metacognitive knowledge than flexible gifted children. Flexible gifted children who solved the problems quickly had more metacognitive knowledge than those who solved them slowly. Among average children, rigid subjects had less metacognitive knowledge, regardless of speed, and flexible average children showed more metacognitive knowledge when they were slower on the problems.",884.0,GIFTEDNESS AND FLEXIBILITY ON A MATHEMATICAL SET-BREAKING TASK,1991.0

Restructuring, school improvement, learning styles, thinking skills, ""at risk,"" cooperative learning, and other issues being discussed throughout education can contribute to strengthening and improving gifted education. Equally important, gifted education can, and should, also bring important issues and lessons to all educators, and make many ""school reform"" and school improvement efforts more powerful. We need to be the strong voice that reminds all educators of the importance of challenging and nurturing the best potentials of all learners, so that minimum competencies will not become maximum competencies.

"THE REFORM MOVEMENT AND THE QUIET CRISIS IN GIFTED EDUCATION   The reform movement in education appears to focus on the ways in which schools are organized and managed rather than on the interaction that takes place among teachers, students, and the material to be learned. In the process of designing reform to encourage our most promising students and also to meet the needs of at-risk students, we need to examine the types of changes currently being advocated. An examination of the various reform efforts and the effect that they are having on gifted education is provided in this article. Rather than allowing all reform movements to affect our students without our consent (especially those that call for the elimination of grouping), we need to address the impact of gifted education programs and practices and how they might influence the reform effort. We must also be concerned with continued advocacy for gifted programming, creating and maintaining exemplary programs and practices that can serve as models of what can be accomplished for high ability students. Simply to allow high ability students to be placed in classrooms in which no provisions will be made for their special needs is an enormous step backwards for our field. To lose our quest for excellence in the current move to guarantee equity will undoubtedly result in a disappointing, if not disastrous, education for our most potentially able children.",892.0,THE REFORM MOVEMENT AND THE QUIET CRISIS IN GIFTED EDUCATION,1991.0
"AN ACADEMIC MODEL FOR EDUCATING THE MATHEMATICALLY TALENTED   A usually unrecognized aspect of the ""school reform"" movement during the past two decades has been the huge increase in extracurricular academic efforts on behalf of intellectually exceptionally able boys and girls. Whereas in 1971 few students less than 14 years old took the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT), by 1990 more than 100,000 did. Those who score well are offered special, supplemental educational opportunities. The movement began at Johns Hopkins University in 1971 with the creation of the Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth (SMPY) and spread within a dozen years to other private universities, i.e., Duke, Northwestern, and the University of Denver. Also, many public universities have begun such talent searching and educational facilitating.
