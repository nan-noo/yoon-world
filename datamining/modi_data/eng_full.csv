1,2021.0,Social–Emotional Characteristics and Adjustment of Accelerated University Students: A Systematic Review,"Social–Emotional Characteristics and Adjustment of Accelerated University Students: A Systematic Review academic acceleration, giftedness, social–emotional adjustment, adjustment to university, systematic review Gifted students who experienced grade-based acceleration in primary or secondary education have to meet the challenges of adjusting to university at a younger age than students who did not accelerate. This systematic review critically evaluates the research on social–emotional characteristics and adjustment of these gifted accelerated university students. Based on a review of 22 studies, we may conclude that accelerated students did not differ very much in domains of social–emotional characteristics from their nonaccelerated gifted and nongifted peers. Factors that facilitated adjustment and well-being were cheerfulness, resilience, self-efficacy, a positive self-concept, high prior academic achievement, and supportive family environment. Furthermore, it was found that studies were incomplete in reporting the previous acceleration experiences of the students and that research on students who individually accelerated by 1 or 2 years was scarce. Future research should include individually accelerated students, previous acceleration experiences, gender differences, and comparison groups."
2,2021.0,Do Mass Media Shape Stereotypes About Intellectually Gifted Individuals? Two Experiments on Stigmatization Effects From Biased Newspaper Reports,"Do Mass Media Shape Stereotypes About Intellectually Gifted Individuals? Two Experiments on Stigmatization Effects From Biased Newspaper Reports attitudes toward the gifted, experimental design, intellectual giftedness, media influence Negative stereotypes about intellectually gifted individuals prevail among teachers and in society although empirical research has debunked them. They are also dominant in mass media representations of gifted individuals such as newspaper reports. The present study investigated whether stereotypic representations in newspaper articles contribute to the stigmatization of gifted individuals and whether nonstereotypic, evidence-based representations might help destigmatize gifted individuals. Two randomized controlled studies with N = 431 and N = 432 university students, respectively, were conducted. In both experiments, the stereotypic representation caused more negative attitudes toward gifted individuals (d = 0.86/0.81), whereas the evidence-based representation caused more positive attitudes (d = −0.54/−0.58), compared with a control group. Quality of previous relationships with gifted persons moderated both effects to some extent; however, both effects were quite robust against potential moderators. Results indicate that the media should be aware of their influence on recipients’ attitudes. Giftedness researchers should more actively join in the public debate to counteract stigmatization of intellectually gifted individuals."
3,2021.0,College Choice: Considerations for Academically Advanced High School Seniors,"College Choice: Considerations for Academically Advanced High School Seniors interviews; thematic analysis; qualitative descriptive When choosing a college, high school students and those who guide them through the process must consider the complex interactions between student-level and institution-level variables in order to achieve an optimal person-environment fit. Ten academically advanced high school students who had chosen and committed to attending a college participated in semistructured interviews in which they rank-ordered and discussed the college choice considerations they used in the decision-making process. This qualitative study describes six themes that were identified across participants. The college-going identity of these academically advanced students was influenced by pressure to attend a highly selective school, social comparisons, and early career exploration opportunities. Additionally, when evaluating institution characteristics, these academically talented high school seniors questioned the relationship between quality, cost, and prestige, appreciated flexible learning options, and sought opportunities for immersion in a domain."
4,2021.0,Intellectual Precocity: What Have We Learned Since Terman?,"Intellectual Precocity: What Have We Learned Since Terman? basic interpretive; mixed methods; psychometrics; assessment; creativity; gifted Over the past 50 years, eight robust generalizations about intellectual precocity have emerged, been empirically documented, and replicated through longitudinal research. Within the top 1% of general and specific abilities (mathematical, spatial, and verbal) over one third of the range of individual differences are to be found, and they are meaningful. These individual differences in ability level and in pattern of specific abilities, which are uncovered by the use of above-level assessments, structure consequential quantitative and qualitative differences in educational, occupational, and creative outcomes. There is no threshold effect for abilities in predicting future accomplishments; and the concept of multipotentiality evaporates when assessments cover the full range of all three primary abilities. Beyond abilities, educational/occupational interests add value in identifying optimal learning environments for precocious youth and, with the addition of conative variables, for modeling subsequent life span development. While overall professional outcomes of exceptionally precocious youth are as exceptional as their abilities, educational interventions of sufficient dosage enhance the probability of them leading exceptionally impactful careers and making creative contributions. Findings have made evident the psychological diversity within intellectually precocious populations, their meaningfulness, and the environmental diversity required to meet their learning needs. Seeing giftedness and interventions on their behalf categorically has held the field back."
5,2021.0,Assessing the Scholarly Reach of Terman's Work,"Assessing the Scholarly Reach of Terman's Work bibliometric; gifted education; Lewis Terman Lewis M. Terman'sGenetic Studies of Geniusstands as one of the landmark studies of the 20th century in the educational and psychological sciences. This longitudinal study of individuals in the top 1% of general cognitive ability has sparked interest and debate among scholars for nearly 100 years. In this study, we examine how Terman'sGenetic Studies of Geniushas influenced academia through a bibliometric citation analysis. We gathered all scholarly works that cited one of the volumes of Terman'sGenetic Studies of Geniusand appeared in academic journals and mapped out the growth of scholarly citations within differing academic fields. We found that the influence of Terman's studies extends beyond the field of education and psychology into business, medicine, and the sciences."
6,2020.0,Reducing Levels of Perfectionism in Gifted and Talented Youth Through a Mindfulness Intervention,"Reducing Levels of Perfectionism in Gifted and Talented Youth Through a Mindfulness Intervention adolescents; ANOVA; MANOVA; mindfulness; perfectionism; quasi-experimental Gifted youth frequently experience perfectionism, which for some can affect their emotional well-being. This study evaluated the effectiveness of a 6-week mindfulness intervention for 42 middle school students who were identified as Gifted and Talented. Participants' levels of self-oriented and socially prescribed perfectionism, as well as their use of mindfulness practices, were evaluated pre- and post- intervention, as well as at a 5-week follow-up to assess changes in perfectionism ratings and use of mindfulness. Three Bonferroni-adjusted, one-way, repeated measures analyses of variance were performed, and the results indicated a significant decrease in self-oriented perfectionism and an increase in mindfulness at both the end of the intervention and at follow-up. These findings support the use of mindfulness as an appropriate intervention to reduce self-imposed forms of perfectionism among gifted youth."
7,2020.0,"Similarities and Differences Between Intellectually Gifted and Average-Ability Students in School Performance, Motivation, and Subjective Well-Being","Similarities and Differences Between Intellectually Gifted and Average-Ability Students in School Performance, Motivation, and Subjective Well-Being giftedness; ability self-concept; vocational interests; academic achievement Terman's study was the first to systematically document the lives of the intellectually gifted. This cross-sectional study replicates and extends some of Terman's findings on characteristics of the gifted in childhood, comparing largely unselected samples of gifted (n = 50) and average-ability (n = 50) adolescents matched by means of propensity score matching. Students were compared on their school performance (standardized math and reading tests and grades), motivation (math ability self-concept, intrinsic motivation, vocational interests, and educational aspirations), parental educational expectations, students' evaluation of school instruction (perceived quality and pressure), and subjective well-being. The gifted scored higher on math performance (rank-biserialr = .66/.81), math ability self-concept (.71), intrinsic motivation (.62), and investigative vocational interests (.65). Some smaller differences were found for realistic (.42) and social interests (-.37) and for pressure in math lessons (-.52). Results support Terman's findings on gifted individuals' psychological functioning and contradict negative stereotypes about the gifted."
8,2020.0,Test-Taking for Gifted and Talented Kindergarten: Underscoring the Importance of Outreach,"Test-Taking for Gifted and Talented Kindergarten: Underscoring the Importance of Outreach diversity; access and equity; gifted identification; information dissemination; matching methods; mixed effects logistic regression; observational study Using proprietary data collected prior to the establishment of the public Universal Prekindergarten program in New York City, this study finds statistically significant differences in test-taking rates for the city's Gifted & Talented (G & T) program between two matched samples of students-those who attended a public prekindergarten (pre-K) program and those who did not-for each of four cohorts from 2008 to 2011, favoring the public pre-K group. Results also demonstrate that access to information about the G & T program is a plausible mechanism underlying the higher test-taking rates among the public pre-K group, especially for underrepresented groups. With the establishment of the Universal Prekindergarten in New York City in 2015, our results highlight the importance of instituting new policies for promoting the dissemination of information regarding the G & T admissions process within the public school sector. If targeted to address diversity in G & T, such policies could help reduce inequality in gifted education."
9,2020.0,Factors Associated With Gifted Identification for Ethnically Diverse Children in Poverty,"Factors Associated With Gifted Identification for Ethnically Diverse Children in Poverty achievement gap; diversity; excellence gap; gifted identification We analyzed data from a large-scale (N= 39,213), longitudinal study of urban students to assess child factors (gender, ethnicity, English language learner status, school readiness skills, type of pre-K attended, early elementary school academic performance) prospectively associated with eventual gifted identification in elementary school. Overall, 14.2% of students were identified as gifted in K-5th grade, with the majority identified by second grade. Multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that White and Latino students were more likely to be identified as gifted than Black students, even controlling for poverty and early academic performance. English language learners, boys, and those who attended public school pre-K programs were more likely to be identified controlling for other factors. School readiness assessments were also useful for predicting giftedness."
10,2020.0,What's in Your Gifted Education Online Teacher Professional Development? Incorporating Theory- and Practice-Based Elements of Instructional Learning Design,"What's in Your Gifted Education Online Teacher Professional Development? Incorporating Theory- and Practice-Based Elements of Instructional Learning Design distance education; gifted; mixed methods; professional development; survey research; teacher education This article examined six theory- and practice-based elements of instructional learning design in online teacher professional development (oTPD), how these elements were implemented into Edinger's PACKaGE model of gifted education oTPD, and how teachers evaluated each element. Elements were based on Berge's (1995) instructor roles model theory and gifted education research. Each element was evaluated by teachers (N= 184) who completed oTPD designed from the PACKaGE model. Self-report survey findings suggest that teachers considered most elements, such as asynchronous discussion board and article review assignments, to be useful to a great extent to their gifted education learning and pedagogy. However, teachers reported less usefulness for the online group project element. This finding directly contrasts with researchers' suggestions for oTPD. These findings may encourage teachers to choose theory- and research-based oTPD. PD designers can investigate and implement oTPD elements that satisfy instructional design model needs for optimal teacher learning and gifted education pedagogy."
11,2020.0,"Galton, Terman, Cox: The Distinctive Volume II in Genetic Studies of Genius","Galton, Terman, Cox: The Distinctive Volume II in Genetic Studies of Genius archival; biographical; historical analysis; early childhood; gifted; intelligence With just one exception, all of the volumes in Terman's Genetic Studies of Genius report the results of a longitudinal study of more than a thousand intellectually gifted children. That single exception is Volume II, Cox's single-authored The Early Mental Traits of Three Hundred Geniuses, which instead was a retrospective study of 301 eminent creators and leaders, using historiometric methods to estimate their IQs (as well as to assess a subset of 100 on 67 character traits). This article discusses how this volume actually fits with the other four volumes in the set. After giving the historical background, discussion turns to the emergence of Cox's doctoral dissertation. Then comes a narrative of the aftermath, including subsequent contributions by Cox, Terman, and numerous other researchers extending into the 21st century. The article closes by treating the ways that the intellectually gifted and the historic geniuses are not comparable, thus indicating the need for more recent replications and extensions of her work."
12,2020.0,Factors Related to Suicidal Cognitions of Academically Gifted Students in the Chinese Social-Cultural Context: An Exploratory Study,"Factors Related to Suicidal Cognitions of Academically Gifted Students in the Chinese Social-Cultural Context: An Exploratory Study academically gifted; positive psychology; suicidal cognition; Chinese; social-cultural context; broaden-and-build theory From the perspective of positive psychology, this study examined the variables in four domains of personal resources under the broaden-and-build theory concerning their relationships with suicidal cognition among academically gifted students. A total of 386 academically gifted secondary school students in China participated in the study. First, the descriptive analysis results indicated that the mean score of suicidal cognition was below average, but these students were experiencing sleep deprivation problem in their daily lives. Second, based on the broaden-and-build theory, correlational analysis results suggested that most of the variables from the four domains of resources were significantly related to suicidal cognition. Most important, regression results showed that cognitive and psychological resources appeared to be the most influential for suicidal cognition. Furthermore, parents should be alerted that, for academically gifted students, parental relationship (social resource) is important, as lack of such a positive relationship (i.e., parents' alienation) showed strong negative effect on suicidal cognition of these students. This was the first study that used the framework of broaden-and-build theory to study and compare the predictive effects of resources on suicidal cognition of academically gifted secondary school students in the Chinese social and cultural contexts."
13,2020.0,Differences in Using the Cognitive Abilities Test (CogAT) 7 Nonverbal Battery Versus the Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test (NNAT) 2 to Identify the Gifted/Talented,"Differences in Using the Cognitive Abilities Test (CogAT) 7 Nonverbal Battery Versus the Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test (NNAT) 2 to Identify the Gifted/Talented Cognitive Abilities Test; Naglieri Nonverbal Abilities Test; identification; nonverbal; school-level norming; local norming; group-specific norming; opportunity to learn The two most commonly used nonverbal tests for gifted identification, the Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test (NNAT) and the Cognitive Abilities Test (CogAT) nonverbal battery, have not been compared in their newer versions to explore the effects of their use on the identification of underserved populations. Additionally, the effects of the use of various norming groups and cutoff scores on both instruments' identification abilities has not been compared. This study compared 15,733 CogAT7 nonverbal battery scores and 14,421 NNAT2 scores of kindergartners between 2013 and 2015 from one large urban school district to explore the differences between how each test relates to major demographic variables and examine the effects on who is selected for participation in gifted programming based on which instrument, which norming group, and which cutoff scores are used. Both instruments were less likely to identify students from demographic groups that have been traditionally underrepresented than students from traditionally overrepresented demographic groups, but identification varied based on the type of norming plan used and which instrument was taken. Suggestions are made as to the best instrument for use with various demographic groups and norming plans."
14,2020.0,Differentiating Among High-Achieving Learners: A Comparison of Classical Test Theory and Item Response Theory on Above-Level Testing,"Differentiating Among High-Achieving Learners: A Comparison of Classical Test Theory and Item Response Theory on Above-Level Testing item response theory; talent search; talent identification This study investigated the application of item response theory (IRT) to expand the range of ability estimates for gifted (hereinafter referred to as high-achieving) students' performance on an above-level test. Using a sample of fourth- to sixth-grade high-achieving students (N = 1,893), we conducted a study to compare estimates from two measurement theories, classical test theory (CTT) and IRT. CTT and IRT make different assumptions about the analysis that impact the reliability and validity of the scores obtained from the test. IRT can also differentiate students based on the student's grade or within a grade by using the unique string of correct and incorrect answers the student makes while taking the test. This differentiation may have implications for identifying or classifying students who are ready for advanced coursework. An exploration of the differentiation for Math, Reading, and Science tests and the impact the different measurement frameworks can have on classification of students are explored. Implications for academic talent identification with the talent search model and development of academic talent are discussed."
15,2020.0,Cyberbullying and Internet Addiction in Gifted and Nongifted Teenagers,"Cyberbullying and Internet Addiction in Gifted and Nongifted Teenagers bullying; generalized linear models; gifted; Internet addiction The present article analyzed whether there are differences between gifted and nongifted teenagers in relation to cyberbullying (either as aggressor or victim) and to Internet addiction (in both the intrapersonal and interpersonal dimensions). Furthermore, the existing relationships between cyberbullying and Internet addiction were explored in a sample of gifted teenagers and their nongifted classmates. Participants were 122 adolescents between 13 and 17 years of age (M = 14.40), in compulsory secondary education, half of whom were considered gifted students. The data obtained through a matched case-control study design revealed no significant differences between gifted students and the rest of the students in terms of the incidence of cyberbullying and Internet addiction. Nevertheless, results from generalized linear models revealed the important role that interpersonal conflicts deriving from Internet addiction play in explaining situations of cyberbullying."

17,2020.0,The Effectiveness of Current Interventions to Reverse the Underachievement of Gifted Students: Findings of a Meta-Analysis and Systematic Review,"The Effectiveness of Current Interventions to Reverse the Underachievement of Gifted Students: Findings of a Meta-Analysis and Systematic Review underachievement interventions; gifted underachievers; academic achievement and psychosocial outcomes; motivation for learning meta-analysis and systematic review; reliability and validity; effect sizes Underachievement of gifted students has been a great concern for the field of gifted education. The current study reviewed 14 recent empirical studies concerning the effectiveness of underachievement interventions on gifted students' achievement outcomes and psychosocial outcomes. Overall, there was no evidence that underachievement interventions significantly improved academic performance of gifted underachievers (g = .09, p = .387), especially in terms of course grades. Gifted underachievers receiving interventions significantly outscored their comparison peers on psychosocial outcomes (g = 0.22, p = .001), which consisted of a variety of measures on self-efficacy, goal valuation, environmental perceptions, self-regulation/motivation, and psychosocial functioning. Qualitative studies generally reported that gifted underachievers benefited from the interventions in terms of increased motivation for learning, improved self-regulation, and finding school more meaningful. Findings need to be viewed in light of the relatively low quality of the evidence from recent research on underachievement interventions."
18,2020.0,Gifted Students' Adjustment and Underachievement in University. An Exploration From the Self-Determination Theory Perspective,"Gifted Students' Adjustment and Underachievement in University. An Exploration From the Self-Determination Theory Perspective adjustment; gifted students; motivation; underachievement Successful transition from school to university is essential for the academic success of any student. Gifted students might encounter unique challenges due to their characteristics, and there is an evidence that a failure to adjust to the demands of university environment has a negative effect on gifted students' academic performance, leading to underachievement. This qualitative study aimed at exploration of gifted students' adjustment to university and issues they face within this process. We use the lenses provided by self-determination theory to further interpret the role of both internal and external motivation forces contributing to gifted students' adjustment and achievement in higher education settings. It was identified that the gifted school and university learning environments, as well as the influence of key people (parents, peers, and teachers) played a crucial role in facilitating or impeding gifted school graduates' sense of self-determination and consequently their adjustment and achievement. This study offers interesting insights for the understanding of gifted (under)achievement in a context where giftedness is predominantly conceived as high intelligence and academic achievement, gifted students are identified via performance-based measures, specialized schools are the preferred means for gifted education, and young people's talents are considered invaluable for the development of the national economy and the society."
19,2020.0,Pay Attention to Inattention: Exploring ADHD Symptoms in a Sample of Underachieving Gifted Students,"Pay Attention to Inattention: Exploring ADHD Symptoms in a Sample of Underachieving Gifted Students ANOVA; MANOVA; attention deficit disorder; attention-deficient; hyperactivity disorder; gifted; motivation; underachievement Much has been written about the relationship of giftedness and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), as well as the relationship between ADHD and underachievement. The present study examined whether students who were identified as gifted underachievers were more likely to manifest symptoms of ADHD, as measured by the ADHD-IV. Over half of the gifted underachievers met the screening criteria for ADHD based on teacher reports, and almost 30% of the gifted underachievers met the screening criteria for ADHD based on parent reports. Most of these students had elevated scores on the inattention scale. The prevalence of inattention was over 2 times as high as the prevalence in the norming sample using the teacher rating scales and over 5 times as high as the prevalence in the norming sample using the parent rating scales. Although parents and teachers rated students similarly on the hyperactivity scale, teachers rated students as more inattentive than parents did. However, elevated parent ratings of inattention negatively predicted students' self-regulation, goal valuation, and self-efficacy. Self-regulation was most strongly related to inattention. We cannot know whether the gifted underachievers with high inattention scores have undiagnosed ADHD. However, our results suggest that a substantial percentage of gifted underachievers exhibit attentional problems at home, and that these attentional problems are severe enough to merit further examination."
20,2020.0,"An Expectancy-Value Approach to Math Underachievement: Examining High School Achievement, College Attendance, and STEM Interest","An Expectancy-Value Approach to Math Underachievement: Examining High School Achievement, College Attendance, and STEM Interest structural equation modeling; secondary data analysis Students' academic underachievement, defined as discrepancies between ability and academic performance, is a widespread problem leading to many negative consequences. Our study examines high school students' math underachievement, its motivational antecedents, and its impact on future math achievement, college attendance, and STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) interest. Using data from the nationally representative High School Longitudinal Study, we identified students who exhibited a math ability-achievement discrepancy between their standardized math scores at the beginning of ninth grade and their final math grade in fall of ninth grade. We then conducted generalized structural equation modeling to identify direct effects of math motivation on math underachievement along with the direct effects of math underachievement on future STEM and college outcomes. Informed by expectancy-value theory, we found that math motivation, as measured by value and expectancy beliefs was significantly associated with math underachievement. We also found that math underachievement was associated with a number of outcomes in the high school to college transition with evidence of moderation by high math ability. Implications for research, practice, and policy are discussed."

We found that academic achievement was disrupted when the participants experienced a sudden increase in curricular demands when transitioning to middle or high school. Participants' negative self-perceptions, lack of learning skills, and negative relationships with teachers commonly contributed to the maintenance of the underachievement. Finally, the underachievement began to resolve when the girls had a clear goal in mind, which for three of them was being accepted to college."
22,2020.0,Cognitive and Achievement Characteristics of Students From a National Sample Identified as Potentially Twice Exceptional (Gifted With a Learning Disability),"Cognitive and Achievement Characteristics of Students From a National Sample Identified as Potentially Twice Exceptional (Gifted With a Learning Disability) academic achievement; cognitive abilities; descriptive; giftedness; learning disabilities It is important to identify cognitive and achievement characteristics that differentiate students who are twice exceptional because they are gifted and have a learning disability (2e-LD) from gifted and average ability peers because this information informs empirically-based identification and support systems for this population. In this study, I classified school-age participants (N = 3,865) in the nationally representative standardization sample for the Woodcock-Johnson IV (WJ IV) Tests of Cognitive Abilities and Achievement as potentially gifted, 2e-LD, or of average ability based on their WJ IV performance. I compared mean levels of performance, strengths and weaknesses, and intraindividual heterogeneity across 2e-LD, gifted, and average-ability groups. The 2e-LD group demonstrated greater heterogeneity in performance, and their strengths and weaknesses were largely consistent with past research and writing on 2e-LD characteristics. Results support some 2e-LD identification recommendations from the literature and highlight the potential benefits of individualized assessment, dual differentiation, and a de-emphasis of speeded academic tasks."

This article describes the development and initial application of the Motivation, Assessment, and Planning (MAP) intervention, developed to meet the needs of freshmen in Advanced Placement (AP) and International Baccalaureate (IB) curricula. MAP is grounded in motivational interviewing and designed to evoke behavior change following one to two individual meetings with a coach. This study used a multimethod, multisource approach to evaluate the applicability and acceptability of MAP as a Tier 2 support for 9th-grade students completing AP/IB coursework. Quantitative and qualitative acceptability data from 49 AP/IB students, 7 coaches, and 3 potential end-users of MAP were examined. Results indicate MAP was perceived as an acceptable intervention for addressing the social-emotional needs of high-achieving students taking AP/IB classes. Findings and directions for further research of MAP are discussed."
24,2020.0,Making Meaning out of MANOVA: The Need for Multivariate Post Hoc Testing in Gifted Education Research,"Making Meaning out of MANOVA: The Need for Multivariate Post Hoc Testing in Gifted Education Research MANOVA; discriminant analysis; multivariate analysis Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) is a statistical method used to examine group differences on multiple outcomes. This article reports results of a review of MANOVA in gifted education journals between 2011 and 2017 (N = 56). Findings suggest a number of conceptual and procedural misunderstandings about the nature of MANOVA and its application, including pervasive use of univariate post hoc tests to interpret MANOVA results. Accordingly, this article aims to make MANOVA more accessible to gifted education scholars by clarifying its purpose and introducing descriptive discriminant analysis as a more appropriate post hoc technique. A heuristic data set is used to demonstrate the procedures for running a descriptive discriminant analysis, both in place of a one-way MANOVA and as a post hoc analysis to a factorial design. SPSS and R syntax are provided."
25,2020.0,MANOVA: A Procedure Whose Time Has Passed?,"MANOVA: A Procedure Whose Time Has Passed? MANOVA; ANOVA; Type I error; SEM; regression Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) is a statistical procedure commonly used in fields such as education and psychology. However, MANOVA's popularity may actually be for the wrong reasons. The large majority of published research using MANOVA focus on univariate research questions rather than on the multivariate questions that MANOVA is said to specifically address. Given the more complicated and limited nature of interpreting MANOVA effects (which researchers may not actually be interested in given the actual post hoc strategies employed) and that various flexible and well-known statistical alternatives are available, I suggest that researchers consult these better known, robust, and flexible procedures instead, given the proper match with the research question of interest. Just because a researcher has multiple dependent variables of interest does not mean that a MANOVA should be used at all."

Two recent federal district court decisions defined the lower limits of equitable participation using the 20% equity allowance formula proposed by Donna Ford. The purpose of this article was to evaluate the application of the 20% rule to identify the prevalence of inequity and associated variables in Texas gifted education programs. Using data from the Office of Civil Rights and Texas Education Agency, the authors applied the 20% rule to demographics of K-12 gifted education programs in Texas to identify inequity and used Bayesian regression with district characteristics to investigate contributing factors of inequity. Only 282 of 994 (28.4%) districts met equity standards for Hispanic students. Second, Bayesian regressions with district-level characteristics of students, teachers, and expenditures were used to identify factors associated with inequitable enrollment of Hispanic students. Overall, the model accounted for 12.9% variance (R-2 = 0.129, 95% highest density interval [0.095, 0.170]), with increasing variance explained by district subsets (i.e., city, suburb, town, rural). Furthermore, the results of the regression models revealed the percentage of Hispanic and White teachers were inversely associated with inequity across all district subsets. It is postulated that the mechanism of inequity is in the teacher referral process, frequently used as a determinant of gifted education enrollment. The authors suggest means of addressing this reality."
28,2019.0,The Effects of Academic Giftedness and Gender on Developmental Trajectories of Hopelessness Among Students Living in Economically Disadvantaged Neighborhoods,"The Effects of Academic Giftedness and Gender on Developmental Trajectories of Hopelessness Among Students Living in Economically Disadvantaged Neighborhoods gender; giftedness; hopelessness; poverty; growth curve modeling; longitudinal Although there is much research on adolescent poverty, research related to youth living in communities characterized by extreme poverty who are also identified as academically gifted is lacking. This study explores the development of hopelessness in these youths, compared with peers not identified as gifted, using data from the Mobile Youth and Poverty Study. Specifically, trajectories of hopelessness as a function of gifted status and gender are explored. Results indicate that boys experience greater feelings of hopelessness than girls, regardless of their gifted status, and students identified as gifted have lower levels of hopelessness than their peers not identified as gifted. These latter differences are particularly pronounced during early adolescence (age 10 years) but decline over time and largely disappear by later adolescence (age 18 years). Results suggest that boys may be particularly vulnerable to declining effects of gifted classification as a protector against hopelessness across age and that disadvantaged students who are identified as gifted may benefit from gifted programs that continue at an intense level through their high school years."
29,2019.0,Machine Learning in Gifted Education: A Demonstration Using Neural Networks,"Machine Learning in Gifted Education: A Demonstration Using Neural Networks gifted education; supervised learning; neural networks Machine learning algorithms are used in language processing, automated driving, and for prediction. Though the theory of machine learning has existed since the 1950s, it was not until the advent of advanced computing that their potential has begun to be realized. Gifted education is a field where machine learning has yet to be utilized, even though one of the underlying problems of gifted education is classification, which is an area where learning algorithms have become exceptionally accurate. We provide a brief overview of machine learning with a focus on neural networks and supervised learning, followed by a demonstration using simulated data and neural networks for classification issues with a practical explanation of the mechanics of the neural network and associated R code. Implications for gifted education are then discussed. Finally, the limitations of supervised learning are discussed. Code used in this article can be found at"
30,2019.0,Who Gets Served in Gifted Education? Demographic Representation and a Call for Action,"Who Gets Served in Gifted Education? Demographic Representation and a Call for Action equity; underrepresentation; assessment; gifted The disproportional representation of students from various demographic subgroups within identified gifted and talented populations has long frustrated policy makers, education advocates, researchers practitioners within the field, and those concerned with societal inequality in general. Despite the prevalence of articles in the media reporting on disproportional representation, little research has been conducted to track whether (a) the representation of these student subgroups, particularly students with limited English proficiency or students with disabilities, has changed over time or (b) states with and without policies differ in proportional representation of students identified with gifts and talents. For example, increasingly, gifted education advocates have pushed for mandates that all students be screened for gifted program eligibility as a way to combat disproportionality, despite little evidence that such methods influence proportionality. Therefore, this study sought to understand whether and how state and national gifted program demographics have changed over time and how proportionality is correlated with state mandates for gifted education identification or services.

31,2019.0,What Boosts Talent Development? Examining Predictors of Academic Growth in Secondary School Among Academically Advanced Youth Across 21 Years,"What Boosts Talent Development? Examining Predictors of Academic Growth in Secondary School Among Academically Advanced Youth Across 21 Years academically gifted; academic talent We examined 482,418 students who took the ACT in the seventh grade and again in high school, taking an exploratory analytic approach to examine academic growth trends from 1996 to 2017. Predictors included sociodemographics, interests, high school (HS) characteristics, HS coursework and GPA, and extracurriculars, which explained 25% of the variance in academic growth. Overall, growth improved from 2005 to 2017, but growth for low-income and Hispanic students was stagnant. Catholic and private school students had the highest growth; homeschooled and high-poverty public school students had the lowest. High growth was associated with STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) elective HS courses and advanced AP, accelerated, and honors courses. Students with investigative and conventional interests had higher growth. Some extracurriculars had significant relationships with academic growth, though the effects were small."
32,2019.0,Presenting a Qualitative Study: A Reviewer's Perspective,"Presenting a Qualitative Study: A Reviewer's Perspective qualitative research; new researchers; researcher bias; approaches; trustworthiness Intended to guide scholars who are new to qualitative research, this methods brief focuses mostly on what reviewers look for in manuscripts submitted for publication. The author acknowledges that reviewers' preferences likely reflect their theoretical perspectives, research-oriented coursework, mentors, and research and writing experiences. The emphasis, therefore, is on terminology and basic elements that apply across a broad range of qualitative approaches. Discussion also addresses researcher inclinations toward qualitative inquiry; the importance of fit among approach, purpose, and research questions; the need for manuscript authors to identify potential researcher bias and explain how it was monitored; and the necessity of including and describing other elements that contribute to trustworthiness. Examples from journals in the field represent a wide range of research types, foci, and data sources."
33,2019.0,On Deciding to Accelerate: High-Ability Students Identify Key Considerations,"On Deciding to Accelerate: High-Ability Students Identify Key Considerations acceleration; group concept mapping; gifted; student beliefs; high-ability students; student voice Acceleration is a well-researched educational intervention supporting positive outcomes for high-ability students. However, access to acceleration may be restricted due to educators' misapprehensions about this practice. To better understand whether students share educators' concerns, our study explored 26 high-ability students' beliefs about important considerations in grade-based acceleration. Seventeen high-ability students who had accelerated (age 9-14 years) participated in group concept mapping activities, which involved sorting and rating a list of student-generated considerations. We applied multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis to the sorted data to create a structured conceptualization of students' advice on deciding to accelerate. Our analyses revealed the following six key concepts, from most to least important: (a) Best Learning Environment, (b) Child's Preferences, (c) Abilities Across Different Subjects, (d) Peer Group, (e) Context and School Support, and (f) Social Considerations. Our interpretations include comparison of high-ability students' advice to existing acceleration guidelines. Practical implications are discussed."

In recent years, an alternative ideology that construes giftedness in an inclusive light and promotes democratic practices has emerged. This ideology posits a new meaning-making system of giftedness that is process-based rather than person-based. In this article, we elaborate some conceptual principles of this emerging ideology. First, we reflect on the nature of giftedness as a social construct using a symbolic interactionist perspective and articulate the dialectical evolution of collective meanings of giftedness. Second, we address the interdependency between an individual and a context when it comes to helping students realize their giftedness. Third, we accentuate a growth orientation and outline the importance of considering giftedness as a process-based entity. Furthermore, we provide a T:CAD conception of giftedness along with ideas for transaction-focused practices that aim to encourage the rendering of this emerging ideology in practice."

While gifted children tend to enjoy favorable peer status, their social functioning during adolescence is less clear. The current study seeks to enhance this understanding by examining both preference- and reputation-based peer status of gifted adolescents. Peer nominations were used to assess the peer status, aggression, victimization, and prosocial leadership of 327 public school seventh graders (44% male; 42% White). School records provided giftedness information, course grade, and standardized test scores, and substance use was self-reported. Gifted students were viewed as less aggressive and more prosocial and had higher academic achievement than nonidentified students. Giftedness moderated the peer status-adjustment relationship. Rejection related to higher victimization and test scores, but these associations were most exaggerated for gifted students. Popularity positively related to aggression and substance use; however, the associations were greatly attenuated for gifted students. Findings underscore the heterogeneity of gifted adolescents' social experiences."

Four parents were trained and coached to use higher level questions, based on the revised Bloom's taxonomy, with their children in home settings during a shared reading routine. A single-case, multiple-probe design across participants was used to examine the parents' ability to learn and implement the higher level questioning strategy during shared reading with their children and the impact this had on the complexity of their children's expressive language. Results indicated that all parents were able to learn and implement the strategy, and the complexity of each child's responses increased. Additionally, these findings were maintained over time and demonstrated that single-case research can be used with gifted student populations to establish causal relationships between interventions and meaningful outcomes."
38,2019.0,"Clarifying the Connections Among Giftedness, Metacognition, Self-Regulation, and Self-Regulated Learning: Implications for Theory and Practice","Clarifying the Connections Among Giftedness, Metacognition, Self-Regulation, and Self-Regulated Learning: Implications for Theory and Practice definition or conception of giftednes; talent; metacognition; self-regulation; self-regulated learning The concept of giftedness has historically been shaped by theories of IQ, creativity, and expertise (including early conceptions of metacognition). These theories focus within the mind of the individual learner. Social, emotional, and motivational qualities of giftedness were treated as add-ons, not part of the core construct. This created misalignment with the social construction of knowledge-a position widely supported in gifted education practice. Newer, broader conceptions of metacognitive, self-regulated, and self-regulated learning processes have garnered interest. However, because these theories borrowed language from each other and earlier theories, assigning new meanings to old constructs, confusion arose about how to distinguish each of these three theories from each other or apply them to instruction. This article distinguishes among metacognition, self-regulation, and self-regulated learning, relating each to notions of giftedness, highlighting implications for practice, and especially highlighting self-regulated learning as a valuable contributor to understanding giftedness and designing instruction in gifted education."

Filial piety and the desire to make their parent(s) proud can motivate these children to achieve but can also place undue pressure on them. In this qualitative study, researchers explored how seven Asian American women who entered college 2 to 4 years earlier than same-aged peers perceived their parents' expectations and the influence of these expectations on their academic and career decision making. In-depth interviews revealed that the majority of women experienced high expectations from their parents for academics and careers. Several also reported experiencing parental pressures, social isolation, eating disorders, and depression during their college years. Implications for well-being are discussed."

Terman's mixed legacy includes the pioneering work in the creation of intelligence tests, the first large-scale longitudinal study, and the earliest discussions of gifted identification, curriculum, ability grouping, acceleration, and more. However, since the 1950s, Terman has been viewed as a sloppy thinker at best and a racist, sexist, and/or classist at worst. This article explores the most common criticisms of Terman's legacy: an overemphasis on IQ, support for the meritocracy, and emphasizing genetic explanations for the origin of intelligence differences over environmental ones. Each of these criticisms is justified to some extent by the historical record, and each is relevant today. Frequently overlooked, however, is Terman's willingness to form a strong opinion based on weak data. The article concludes with a discussion of the important lessons that Terman's work has for modern educators and psychologists, including his contributions to psychometrics and gifted education, his willingness to modify his opinions in the face of new evidence, and his inventiveness and inclination to experiment. Terman's legacy is complex, but one that provides insights that can enrich modern researchers and practitioners in these areas."

Four major themes explained the development of his leadership talent. Crucial family factors and support served as a foundation for his psychosocial development and contributed significantly to his talents as a leader. Emotional intelligence evident in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood was an important asset as his leadership skills grew. In addition, strong practical intelligence applied to his everyday life enabled him to meet the goals and objectives he established for himself. Woven throughout his life story was evidence of a strong internal motivation that drove him personally and professionally. Implications of the findings are presented along with suggestions for designing effective leadership development experiences for talented students."

In the first phase, interview data from 26 Australian adolescents, who were simultaneously intellectually gifted and of low socioeconomic status background, were analyzed using grounded theory to develop four models of occupational/career decision-making processes. In the second phase, a model that incorporated all of the constructs and relationships identified in each of the four models developed in the first phase of the study was tested and refined using structural equation modeling procedures on survey data collected from 917 economically disadvantaged intellectually gifted Australian adolescents. The resulting qualitatively developed and quantitatively refined model allowed for a clearer and a more complete understanding of the occupational/career decision-making processes of intellectually gifted adolescents from economically disadvantaged backgrounds."
44,2019.0,Profoundly Gifted Students' Perceptions of Virtual Classrooms,"Profoundly Gifted Students' Perceptions of Virtual Classrooms gifted education; profoundly gifted; online learning; virtual classrooms The intent of this case study is to understand profoundly gifted students' perceptions of virtual programs. The participants for this study were five profoundly gifted students who were enrolled in a fully virtual writing course hosted by a school that serves the profoundly gifted population. The researcher gathered data via asynchronous focus groups on an online discussion board, observations of synchronous sessions in their virtual classroom, and individual interviews with the participants. The participants reported a preference for frequent interactions with classmates and the instructor, but expressed concern about the lack of social opportunities. While technical difficulties did occur, these were mostly due to operator error or disuse of available tools. Finally, in terms of curriculum and pedagogy, the participants saw little difference between brick-and-mortar and virtual classrooms, suggesting that for profoundly gifted students, the quality of the content and instruction outweighs the realities of the learning environment. This information can be used either to improve online gifted education, or create new programs, thus diversifying opportunities."

Welch's F tests revealed no statistically significant difference in growth or fixed mindset beliefs about intelligence among groups. Gifted and advanced students scored higher on Personal Standards (gifted, d = 0.68; advanced, d = 0.62) and Academic Self-Perception (gifted,d = 0.72; advanced, d = 0.58) compared with typical students. In hierarchical regression models, giftedness was a statistically significant predictor for Concern over Mistakes ( = 0.20) and Personal Standards ( = 0.27); both gifted ( = 0.31) and advanced ( = 0.17) status were statistically significant predictors for Academic Self-Perception. Various models showed a positive association between growth mindset and Positive Strivings Perfectionism and achievement attitudes and a positive association between fixed mindset and Evaluative Concerns Perfectionism. Findings suggest that gifted students are not more vulnerable to develop fixed mindsets."
46,2018.0,Predictors of Success Among High School Students in Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate Programs,"Predictors of Success Among High School Students in Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate Programs accelerated curricula; high school students; risk and resiliency factors; student success Research has shown that students in Advanced Placement (AP) classes and International Baccalaureate (IB) programs experience higher levels of stress compared to students in general education classes. Elevated stress can serve as a risk factor for students' academic and mental health problems. Given the documented stress of these students, additional investigations are needed to more fully understand how students experience these curricula and the factors associated with positive student outcomes. Thus, we set out to identify factors associated with success among AP/IB students, with an emphasis on exploring potentially malleable factors that could be targeted with existing or newly developed interventions. Data were collected via self-report measures and school records from 2,379 students (Grades 9-12) enrolled in AP or IB in 20 school programs in one state. We examined the relationships among 34 predictors (e.g., stressors, coping styles, student engagement, family factors, school factors, and demographic features) of success. Success was represented by five outcomes in two domains: mental health (life satisfaction, psychopathology, school burnout) and academic (GPA, AP/IB exam scores). Better outcomes in both domains were associated with higher levels of achievement motivation and cognitive engagement, as well as lower levels of parent-child conflict, stress from major life events, and use of avoidance coping strategies. Higher levels of affective engagement, use of approach coping, and authoritative parenting were robust predictors of positive mental health outcomes and unrelated (in multivariate analyses) to academic outcomes. Findings have implications for subsequent development of intervention efforts targeting factors associated with student success."

Because gifted education research relies on the same underlying statistical and sociological paradigms, it is likely that it too suffers from these problems. This article discusses the origin of the poor replicability and introduces a set of open science practices that can increase the rigor and trustworthiness of gifted education's scientific findings: preregistration, open data and open materials, registered reports, and preprints.

Educational leaders cannot improve the teaching and learning process without quality measurement of effective teaching. One way to capture this complex interaction is by using structured observations. However, the extant literature on classroom observation instruments in the field of gifted education is limited. For that reason, a systematic search was undertaken to identify the observation instruments for assessing instructional practices used with gifted and talented students. In this article, eight observation instruments were identified: (a) Rating Scale of Significant Behaviors in Teachers of the Gifted, (b) Kulieke's adaptation of the Rating Scale of Significant Behaviors in Teachers of the Gifted, (c) Teaching Observation Form (TOF; also known as Purdue Observation Form), (d) Classroom Practices Record (CPR), (e) Classroom Practices Record-Form VA (CPR-Form VA), (f) Classroom Instructional Practices Scale (CIPS), (g) Classroom Observation Scales-Revised (COS-R), and (h) Differentiated Classroom Observation Scale (DCOS). The instruments are described in terms of developmental process, purpose, and any reliability and validity evidence reported. This systematic search has shown the need for a new observation instrument that is comprehensive and closely tied to professional standards."

In addition, parents' sociocultural contexts, including race and ethnicity, can influence their parenting practice. We conducted interviews with 10 Asian American parents from diverse ethnic backgrounds and analyzed the interview transcripts by using a phenomenological framework and general inductive approach. Themes identified included the parents' recognition of and reaction to twice-exceptionality, challenges and efforts in supporting their children, and perception of their sociocultural contexts in relation to parenting practices. The Asian American parents in this study developed resilient parenting styles and persistent advocacy efforts as they navigated the complex characteristics of twice-exceptionality within their multilayered cultural contexts. Findings are particularly important for practitioners and educators who work with Asian American parents and/or high-ability children with disabilities to better address their complex needs."

Participants consisted of 183 middle and high school students attending a university summer program for academically talented youth. Study 1 results indicated that JMAI scores were internally consistent and yielded an interpretable two-factor structure after the elimination of several items; however, the scores were not significantly or meaningfully related to GPA or current and future mathematics achievement. In Study 2 (n = 30), JMAI scores did not predict students' metacognitive behaviors during mathematics problem-solving tasks. In contrast, students' metacognitive behaviors observed during problem solving were meaningfully related to mathematics achievement with medium to high effect sizes. Findings support the predictive validity of metacognition with regard to academic achievement when operationalized with problem-solving interviews, but call into question the criterion-related validity of JMAI scores."

Additionally, the effect of using the CogAT7 nonverbal battery on the identification of diverse demographic groups based on various norming, cutoff, and modifier plans has only just begun to be explored. In this study, we analyzed the CogAT7 nonverbal battery scores of kindergartners from a very large urban school district with a high minority, low socioeconomic status, and high English language learner population to determine the relationships between demographic variables and CogAT performance. The results suggest relationships between CogAT scores and multiple demographic variables, similar to other nonverbal instruments. We also examined the effects of various norming practices, including school-level and group-specific norming, on identification using the CogAT7 nonverbal battery."

To address this concern, researchers created novel nontraditional identification methods (e.g., nonverbal tests, student portfolios, affective checklists). This meta-analysis of 54 studies, consisting of 85 effect sizes representing 191,287,563 students, provides evidence that nontraditional identification methods, while able to narrow the proportional identification gap between underrepresented (Black, Hispanic, and Native American) and represented (Asian and White American) populations, are still unable to address the issue of education inequity. An overall risk ratio of 0.34 was calculated for nontraditional methods of identification in comparison with a 0.27 risk ratio for traditional methods. While the nontraditional methods help identify more underrepresented students as gifted, the results of this meta-analysis show that better identification methods are needed to address inequities in identification."

In this study, suggested GLD identification criteria were applied to a nationally representative sample of school-age students to determine the number and characteristics of students identified by each set of GLD criteria. Many but not all students identified as potentially GLD had relative weaknesses in lower order processing abilities and achievement, as hypothesized for this population. Students also exhibited academic strengths, which suggests dual differentiation would be appropriate. Commonly used intraindividual discrepancy criteria identified most potentially gifted students as potentially learning disabled; therefore, these are not valid stand-alone criteria to identify learning disabilities in gifted youth. Results suggest it may be best to combine alternative gifted criteria, an intraindividual LD criterion, and examination of absolute deficits in processing and achievement. Additional implications for research and practice are discussed."
56,2018.0,Making the Cut in Gifted Selection: Score Combination Rules and Their Impact on Program Diversity,"Making the Cut in Gifted Selection: Score Combination Rules and Their Impact on Program Diversity Identification; assessment; cut-scores; diversity The recommendation of using multiple measures is common in policy guidelines for gifted and talented assessment systems. However, the integration of multiple test scores in a system that uses cut-scores requires choosing between different methods of combining quantitative scores. Past research has indicated that OR combination rules (where any one score must meet the cutoff) have been shown to identify the largest number of students compared with AND (where all scores must meet cutoff) and AVERAGE (where the numerical average is used) rules. We extended this work to a real data set (Grades K to 5 from the CogAT 7 national standardization data) and found that the different combination rules led to differences in the number and diversity of students identified. However, we found these diversity differences were due mainly to the identified pool size and not to the effects of the particular combination rule. This has important implications for practice."

The Autism Spectrum Screening Questionnaire (ASSQ) and Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) are two common screening tools for ASD used within research and practice settings. We investigated the accuracy of the ASSQ and SRS for ASD identification among a sample of 23 high-ability youth previously diagnosed with ASD. Results suggest both ASSQ and SRS measures inconsistently screened for ASD. The high-ability students with ASD scored significantly lower on the SRS total score and social cognition, communication, and motivation subscales, suggesting potential phenotypic differences among high-ability youth with ASD that could inform assessment and intervention strategies."

Teacher and parent ratings were compared with regard to accuracy levels and halo effects. Furthermore, this study explored the correlations between teacher and parent ratings and how they are related to school grades. The study was based on data from 572 elementary school students participating in an enrichment program. The results indicated the same accuracy levels for teachers and parents. However, teacher ratings were more strongly affected by halo effects than parent ratings. The correlations between teacher and parent ratings were small to medium. Both raters' ratings were independently and positively associated with German grades when controlling for each other. Positive teacher or parent ratings of mathematical abilities and engagement buffered the relation between the other rater's ratings and math grades."

Three themes were identified through the qualitative analysis: Constraining Environments, Integration versus Isolation, and Resource Plenty versus Resource Poor. Students in both groups experienced environments not conducive to learning, inhibiting peers, and teachers as a barrier. Students in the low-income group described mayhem in their schools, which interfered significantly with learning. These students were highly integrated in their school community, whereas the students in the high-income group were socially isolated from both peers and teachers. Both groups exhibited issues of poor fit within their schools: autonomy and competence for both, relatedness for students in the high-income group. Attention to these issues will help support these students in achieving their potential."

To examine the effects of institutional and individual poverty on student identification, we conducted a series of three-level regression models. Students of poverty are generally less likely to be identified for gifted services, even after controlling for prior math and reading achievement. Furthermore, school poverty predicts the percentage of gifted students identified in a school. Within districts, even after controlling for reading and math scores, the poorer schools in a district have lower identification rates. Whereas students of poverty are generally less likely to be identified for gifted services, poor students in poor schools are even less likely to be identified as gifted."

Specifically, the authors explored the following questions: (a) What are the characteristics of studies published that explore the intersection of giftedness, poverty, and students of color? (b) How do scholars discuss and theorize about how to recruit and retain gifted students of color who come from families living in poverty? (c) In what ways do scholars discuss the intersection of race and poverty for gifted students of color? Findings indicated that while studies were focused on students of color, there was limited discussion about the impact of race and poverty on the recruitment and retention of gifted students of color who come from families living in poverty.

In this article, we examine income-based excellence gaps and describe recent controversies in the definition and measurement of poverty, with an eye toward their application to gifted education and meeting the needs of talented, economically vulnerable students. Regardless of how poverty is conceptualized, evidence suggests that U.S. childhood poverty rates are indeed high, both in absolute terms and relative to other countries, and that income-related achievement disparities are similarly large. Recommendations are included for interventions to close persistent poverty excellence gaps, including frontloading, broadened understanding of opportunity, universal screening using local norms, improved educator preparation and support, state K-12 accountability systems that reward schools for closing excellence gaps, widespread use of ability grouping, and selective use of psychosocial interventions at the college level."

Early interventions with learners of high potential from underserved groups, including exposure to challenging curriculum and summer opportunities, are important for nurturing these students' talents and preparing them for advanced learning opportunities in later school years. Project SPARK, based on the Young Scholars model, focuses on recognizing and responding to high-potential learners from underserved populations in the early grades. In this study, we examined the effects on mathematics achievement of participation in a summer program as part of Project SPARK in schools with substantial populations of students in poverty, as demonstrated by percentage of students eligible for free or reduced lunch. We examined summer program effects on achievement for the sample overall and specifically for students from low-income backgrounds. Students who participated in the summer program made moderately larger mathematics achievement gains than students who did not participate, with Cohen's d-type effect sizes of 0.92. Students who qualified for free or reduced lunch saw similar gains over the summer if they participated in the summer program, indicating that the summer program experience was supportive for students across a range of income backgrounds."

Family adversity and difficult personal experiences during adolescence were major themes; however, students benefitted from emotionally supportive K-12 educators and academic rigor in high school. Sustained family pride helped to keep them focused on reaching their goals, as well as intellectual engagement at the university, and influential mentors. The 10 participants developed a strong sense of purpose at the university and graduated well prepared for careers and graduate school. Implications of the findings are presented along with suggestions for designing effective university experiences for talented first-generation students."
69,2018.0,A Talent for Tinkering: Developing Talents in Children From Low-Income Households Through Engineering Curriculum,"A Talent for Tinkering: Developing Talents in Children From Low-Income Households Through Engineering Curriculum biography; curriculum; engineering; poverty; talent development; talent spotting Guided by the theoretical framework of curriculum as a platform for talent development, this quasi-experimental field study investigated an intervention focused on engineering curriculum and curriculum based on a biography of a scientist through a comparative design implemented in low-income schools. Student outcome measures included science content achievement, engineering knowledge, and engineering engagement. The sample comprised 1,387 Grade 1 students across 62 classrooms. Multilevel modeling was used separately for each of the three student outcome measures. The intervention resulted in an effect size of 0.28 on an out-of-level science content assessment and effect size of 0.66 for the engineering knowledge measure. Students in the intervention group reported a high level of engineering engagement. General education teachers were trained to implement the curricula through a summer institute and received coaching throughout the subsequent academic year. Evidence suggests the intervention functioned as a talent-spotting tool as teachers reported they would nominate a substantial portion of low-income and culturally diverse students for subsequent gifted and talented services. Discussion focused on the match between the needs and preferences of students from low-income households for hands-on design experiences and the curricular affordances in the engineering domain as a talent development pathway for young, poor children."
70,2017.0,Measuring Creative Capacity in Gifted Students: Comparing Teacher Ratings and Student Products,"Measuring Creative Capacity in Gifted Students: Comparing Teacher Ratings and Student Products creativity; elementary; rubric; teacher rating; gifted; gender differences Creativity and giftedness are frequently associated, and schools may use measures of creativity for identifying gifted and talented students. The researchers examined three aspects of elementary student creativity: (a) the relationship between a teacher's rating of student creativity and rubric-scored student writing samples, (b) group differences regarding creativity between identified gifted and general education students, and (c) potential gender differences evident in teacher ratings of creativity as well as creative products. Participants in the study were 155 Grade 4 students in an urban district in a southwestern state. Teacher ratings on three different scales were related to student creative products, yielding Pearson correlations ranging from r = .20 to r = .27. Identified gifted students scored higher than general education students in both teacher ratings of creativity (d = 0.83) and written products (d = 0.53). Female students scored higher than male students in both teacher ratings of creativity (d = 0.22) and written products (d = 0.57). These findings suggest that teacher ratings moderately predict creative student products. Identified gifted students scored consistently higher than general education students in creativity, and females scored slightly higher than males on creativity measures."

It is estimated that a quarter of students with high potential leave school without a high school diploma; however, research on how high-potential students uniquely experience dropping out of school is in its beginning stages. This study sought to acquire a rich understanding of how 14 gifted individuals who did not complete high school interpreted this experience and the meaning they attributed to it. Six major themes emerged from the data: (a) significant external circumstances, (b) need for support, (c) social influences, (d) outlets, (e) an alternate path, and (f) reflecting on the path. This exploratory study enhances our understanding of why gifted students choose to leave school and supports the validity of alternate paths to success."
72,2017.0,Online Teacher Professional Development for Gifted Education: Examining the Impact of a New Pedagogical Model,"Online Teacher Professional Development for Gifted Education: Examining the Impact of a New Pedagogical Model online teacher professional development; model; gifted education This article theoretically develops and examines the outcomes of a pilot study that evaluates the PACKaGE Model of online Teacher Professional Development (the Model). The Model was created to facilitate positive pedagogical change within gifted education teachers' practice, attitude, collaboration, content knowledge, and goal effectiveness. Kirkpatrick and Kirkpatrick's model of training evaluation suggests that trainees should evaluate the training for satisfaction at the time the training is completed, as well as 6 months after, to evaluate for behavior change. Applying Kirkpatrick and Kirkpatrick's model, findings indicate that teachers were immediately satisfied with the Model's effectiveness, adequacy, and overall quality. Six months after the online teacher professional development, teachers indicated a strong positive change in each of the five gifted education pedagogical components. Overall, these preliminary findings suggest that the use of the Model creates a positive change within teachers' gifted education pedagogy."
73,2017.0,"Exploring the Spatial Ability of Undergraduate Students: Association With Gender, STEM Majors, and Gifted Program Membership","Exploring the Spatial Ability of Undergraduate Students: Association With Gender, STEM Majors, and Gifted Program Membership spatial ability; mental rotation; gender differences; gifted students; STEM; path analysis Spatial ability has been valued as a talent domain and as an assessment form that reduces cultural, linguistic, and socioeconomic status biases, yet little is known of the spatial ability of students in gifted programs compared with those in general education. Spatial ability is considered an important indicator of potential talent in the domains of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). This study explored undergraduate students' spatial ability, focusing on mental rotation, by investigating the relationships of three variables with performance on a spatial ability test, in terms of test scores and test completion time. A three-way analysis of variance revealed statistically significant main effects of gifted program participation, choice of academic major, and gender, suggesting that students who participated in a gifted program, who majored in a STEM discipline, or who were male outperformed their counterparts on a measure of spatial ability when the other conditions were equivalent. No interaction effects existed among the three variables, indicating that none of them functioned as a moderator of students' performance on the spatial ability assessment. However, when spatial ability was considered as a mediating variable in a path model, gender had the largest total effect on the probability of students majoring in a STEM area. In addition, the more time students spent on the spatial ability test, the better they tended to perform, which is a finding inconsistent with current literature."

The investigation included two closely related studies. The first study included 77 high-ability students from several cultures and economic backgrounds who participated in the 2014 summer program. The second was a retrospective study with 24 Native American students from Dine, Ojibwe, and Lakota tribes who had participated in the affective curriculum in 2013 to determine if their participation had any longer term effects on this subgroup. In general, the students from all backgrounds in both studies said the small-group discussions enriched their overall program experience. Twenty-two of the 24 Native American students from the three tribes who participated in the retrospective study reported that they believed they had changed their behaviors during the past year because of their participation in the small-group discussions the previous summer. The changes mentioned most by these students were exhibiting stronger self-confidence and being more open to people. The results of this study suggests that the affective intervention was regarded positively. It provided both short- and long-term benefits to the high-ability students who participated in the program."

However, while the number of studies escalates, the field as a whole has been criticized for producing fragmented and piecemeal results. One of the reasons for these shortfalls is that the field has invested little in meta-theoretical aspects, such as historical perspectives and philosophical foundations. This article is a comprehensive review and analysis of the conceptual changes and paradigm shifts in gifted education. Three major paradigm shifts in gifted education were identifieddemystification (i.e., giftedness as manifested wonders), identification (i.e., giftedness as measurable predictions), and transaction (i.e., effectuation of human possibilities). Presently, there is still an implicit focus on the identification paradigm despite considerable efforts to shift the focus to creating and sustaining appropriate developmental niches for all individuals. Debates in the field are highlighted to provoke discussion of future directions."

Although grounded in available psychological research, significant questions remain regarding practical applications of each tenet of the model. In this article, we highlight a method of implementing the model's focus on domain-specific abilities. Mathematics was selected as a domain with sufficient literature and importance to serve as the first in a series of proposed explorations into identifying domain-specific abilities. The methodology adapts an identification procedurethat is, auditioncommonly used in performance domains (e.g., dance) to determine drop-dead abilities needed for successful talent developmentin this case, mathematics. Identifying abilities central to potential creative talent in a domain may allow us to move away from relying solely on standardized measures of general ability and academic achievement, especially for the early identification of talent."
78,2017.0,Envisioning a New Foundation for Gifted Education: Evolving Complexity Theory (ECT) of Talent Development,"Envisioning a New Foundation for Gifted Education: Evolving Complexity Theory (ECT) of Talent Development characteristic versus maximal adaptation; evolving complexity; biology versus culture; talent development; developmental stages and transitions This article presents a new theory of talent development, evolving complexity theory (ECT), in the context of the changing theoretical directions as well as the landscape of gifted education. I argue that gifted education needs a new foundation that provides a broad psychosocial basis than what the notion of giftedness can afford. A focus on talent development rather than giftedness should be based on a theory of talent development that is truly developmental, treating the developing person as an open, dynamic, and adaptive system, changing oneself adaptively while interacting with environmental opportunities and challenges. To introduce ECT, I first delineate the meaning and significance of four dimensions or parameters of talent development undergirding this new theory: domain, person, development, and culture. I then describe how ECT explicates the developmental processes and transitions as the result of human adaptations to environmental opportunities and challenges. More specifically, ECT uses the constructs of characteristic and maximal adaptation to elucidate how domain, person, development, and culture jointly shape a particular line of talent development, and how cognitive, affective, and social processes interact to push and sustain a critical transition from characteristic adaptation to maximal adaptation, eventually leading to high-caliber performance and creative productivity. I finally discuss the theoretical contributions and practical utilities of ECT for future research and practice."
79,2017.0,Systemic Gifted Education: A Theoretical Introduction,"Systemic Gifted Education: A Theoretical Introduction systemic gifted education; actiotope; educational capital; learning capital Over the past few decades, systemic thinking has gained in popularity in developmental and learning sciences. The trend has, however, shown up in gifted education research only occasionally. The aim of this article is to introduce systemic thinking to the field of giftedness and explore possibilities for its application. In the first part, a definition of a system is provided and basic concepts of systemic thinking are introduced. In the second part, a full-fledged systemic model is introduced, the actiotope model of giftedness. In the third part, implications for gifted education are elaborated. In the discussion, the authors explain (a) how systemic thinking can make a valuable contribution to gifted education, (b) why systemic thinking will complement rather than replace current approaches to gifted education, and (c) the necessity of combining systemic thinking with other empirically testable theories."
80,2017.0,The Network Concept of Creativity and Deep Thinking: Applications to Social Opinion Formation and Talent Support,"The Network Concept of Creativity and Deep Thinking: Applications to Social Opinion Formation and Talent Support creativity; charisma; deep thinking; deliberative democracy; gifted education; social networks Our century has unprecedented new challenges, which need creative solutions and deep thinking. Contemplative, deep thinking became an endangered species in our rushing world of Tweets, elevator pitches, and fast decisions. Here, we describe how important aspects of both creativity and deep thinking can be understood as network phenomena of conceptual and social networks. Creative nodes occupy highly dynamic, boundary spanning positions in social networks. Creative thinking requires alternating plasticity-dominated and rigidity-dominated mind-sets, which can be helped by dynamically changing social network structures. In the closing section, we present three case studies which demonstrate the applications of the concept in the Hungarian research student movement, the Hungarian Templeton Program, and the Youth Platform of the European Talent Support Network. These examples show how talent support programs can mobilize the power of social networks to enhance creative, deliberative, deep thinking of talented young minds, influencing social opinion, leading to community action, and developing charismatic leadership skills."

We do so by describing and discussing Project Excite, a working example that demonstrates such a model in the context of gifted education. We first trace the history, the impetus, and key design elements of Project Excite, a front-loading intervention aiming to develop the potential of underrepresented students for advanced science, technology, engineering, and mathematics learning from early grades. We review a line of past research and key findings on Project Excite over its 14-year journey. We then discuss the implication of Project Excite for gifted programming in gifted education. Last, we pinpoint some questions to inspire future research and practice."

However, without changes and implementation of these policies, systematic change is unlikely to occur. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to argue that policy research should be a top priority. To begin, we define and contrast three terms common in crafting policypolicy, advocacy, and intervention. Next, we provide a context of previous policy research in gifted education. We then detail areas in which policy research is the most critical. Finally, we conclude with action steps to engage more researchers and practitioners in policy development, implementation, and monitoring."

Large Numbers of Students Start the School Year Above Grade Level grouping; diversity; age; developmental stage; differentiation; achievement Few topics have garnered more attention in preservice teacher training and educational reform than student diversity and its influence on learning. However, the actual degree of cognitive diversity has yet to be considered regarding instructional implications for advanced learners. We used four data sets (three state-level and one national) from diverse contexts to evaluate how many students perform above grade level in English Language Arts and mathematics. Results revealed that among American elementary and middle school students, 20% to 49% in English Language Arts and 14% to 37% in mathematics scored 1 year or more above grade level. We address what these findings imply for K-12 schools, grouping decisions, and educational policies that strive to foster advanced abilities."

Comparative studies on the effectiveness of one-on-one versus group mentoring are lacking, however. The authors investigated this question in the context of a Germany-wide online mentoring program that employed both approaches. Study participants were girls enrolled in high-achiever-track secondary education in Germany (N = 347) who were mentored online by female academics in STEM for 6 months, in either one-on-one (N = 156) or group mentoring (N = 191). It was assumed that the specific many-to-many group-mentoring condition examined in our study would be more effective than the one-on-one mentoring condition with respect to (a) the proportion of STEM communication and (b) the extent of STEM-related networking, both of which are important predictors of successful mentoring. Furthermore, the authors (c) expected more growth in elective intentions for the group-mentoring participants and (d) assumed that participants' centrality in their respective STEM networks would predict this increase. The study presents empirical support for all four assumptions and thus suggests that the special form of group mentoring examined here may be a more successful measure of extracurricular gifted education for girls in STEM than one-on-one mentoring."

The goal of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of an expanded above-level testing model to identify high-potential rural students for an extracurricular math and science enrichment program. Results from our analyses indicated that a more inclusive talent pool differentiated among high achievers to find greater percentages (13%) of talented students compared with most gifted programs (3% to 5%) or Talent Search programs (5%). Overall, students' math and science scores were related to a 75% and 50%, respectively, greater odds in being identified for the extracurricular program. Regardless of program participation, all talent pool students increased their math and science achievement; however, there were some significant gender differences."

Participants were 254 licensed preschool center directors in a southern state. Participants completed a researcher-created survey including both selected response items and constructed response items to examine the perceived challenges of providing preschool gifted education services. Ninety-five percent of the preschool center directors had no formal policies or practices for gifted education, and 86% of the center directors had provided no gifted education training to staff. Using qualitative techniques of constant comparative analysis, substantive and theoretical categories yielded seven verifiable themes related to perceived challenges of gifted education in preschool centers: (a) finding and retaining a trained and qualified staff; (b) balancing time, space, and money constraints; (c) implementing gifted education practices; (d) overcoming oppositional beliefs; (e) acquiring educational resources; (f) outside factors; and (g) finding information and guidance. Results of this study imply that preschool educators have misunderstandings about gifted education in early childhood, and model policies and practices for recognizing and serving gifted children in preschool settings may be needed."

Thirty-eight intellectually gifted and 44 intellectually average children were recruited, and their collaborative and individual recall performances were tested. The results showed that intellectually gifted children had better clustering strategy than their peers when adjusted ratio of clustering scores were calculated (p < .01); clustering strategy positively correlated with recall performance in intellectually average children (p < .05), while no such correlation was found in intellectually gifted children (p = .95); there was no collaborative inhibition in the gifted group (p = .82). These findings partly resolve the conflicts in individual research and expand on the conclusions regarding collaborative memory."

Using district classifications assigned by the National Center for Education Statistics and Texas school district data (n = 1,029) from the Academic Excellence Indicator System, the role of school district classification on gifted education outcomes was investigated. Contextual variables such as school demographics and school size were also examined. The study focused on rural and town school districts which are further classified as fringe, distant, or remote (level of proximity) within those two broad categories. Results of one-way multivariate analysis of variance indicated an effect of proximity for both rural and town districts on both contextual variables and gifted education outcomes. Additionally, rural fringe districts were found to be more similar to districts not classified as rural (i.e., urban, suburban, town) than to rural distant and rural remote districts. Findings offer important implications for both the support for gifted education in rural settings and the usefulness of the census codes as an indicator in educational research."

While much work has been done exploring teachers' beliefs as they relate to the nomination of students for gifted programs, little work has yet explored the ways in which teachers' beliefs about student giftedness possibly affect instructional decisions. In this article, within the context of specialized STEM schools, the beliefs of teachers as related to their students' giftedness and ability are explored. Findings indicated that teachers believe their students to be gifted regardless of designation. Teachers articulated beliefs around the type of learning opportunities gifted students need as well as the amount of work required to stimulate these students. Specifically, teachers stated that gifted students flourish under heavy workloads with intense amounts of independent and inquiry-based learning. Students were also queried to determine their own perceptions of these instructional practices on their learning and daily lives."

The kindergarten Project M-2 units focus on challenging geometry and measurement concepts by positioning students as practicing mathematicians. The research reported herein highlights the features of the kindergarten units and reports on student achievement, including the differences between the intervention and comparison groups. Hierarchical linear modeling results indicate that students in the intervention group (n = 210) outperformed those in the comparison group (n = 196) on the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills Mathematics subscale (p < .01; d = 0.25), and an open-response assessment (p < .001; d = 2.68) encompassing performance-based, verbal, and written components.

In addition, we investigated the extent to which teachers' beliefs about students' academic, motivational, and social development after grade skipping may explain teachers' acceptance of this accelerative strategy. Moreover, we examined whether teachers' acceptance is linked to their decisions about using this intervention. Using data from the PARS project, which included 316 teachers from 18 secondary schools in the German federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia, we assessed teachers' acceptance, beliefs, and perceived knowledge about grade skipping using 4-point rating scales. Teachers also reported whether they had advised a student to skip a grade. Multilevel regression analyses indicated that teachers' beliefs about students' social, motivational, and academic development largely explained their acceptance. Teachers who showed a higher level of acceptance and perceived knowledge were more likely to have recommended grade skipping before. Educational implications are discussed."

Parenting styles and child psychosocial adjustment were measured using self-report questionnaires. Nineteen of the 48 gifted children in the sample (39.6%) were described by their parents as having peer social problems, descriptions that were not consistent with results obtained from the children and their teachers. Mothers also reported more child conduct problems than did the teachers. No associations were found between parenting styles and social problems with peers. Although the findings supported existing research on fathers' parenting styles, some of the relationships between mothers' parenting style and gifted child outcomes were not consistent with previous studies on parenting styles."
99,2016.0,The Impact of the Nomination Stage on Gifted Program Identification: A Comprehensive Psychometric Analysis,"The Impact of the Nomination Stage on Gifted Program Identification: A Comprehensive Psychometric Analysis identification; nomination; psychometrics; sensitivity; ROC The use of the nomination stage as the first step in the identification process is pervasive across the field of gifted education. In many cases, nominations are used to limit the number of students who will need to be evaluated using costly and time-consuming assessments for the purpose of gifted program identification and placement. This study evaluated the effect of the nomination stage on the overall efficacy of a gifted identification system. Results showed that in nearly all conditions, identification systems that require a nomination before testing result in a large proportion of gifted students being missed. Under commonly implemented conditions, the nomination stage can cause the false negative rate to easily exceed 60%. Changes to identification practices are urgently needed in order to ensure that larger numbers of gifted students receive appropriate educational placement and to maintain the integrity of gifted education services."
100,2016.0,Inattentional Blindness in 9-to 10-Year-Old Intellectually Gifted Children,"Inattentional Blindness in 9-to 10-Year-Old Intellectually Gifted Children inattentional blindness; attention; intelligence; intellectually gifted children Researchers suggest that while intellectually gifted children might not always display adequate focus on their general life, they perform very well on experimental attentional tasks. The current study used inattentional blindness (IB) paradigm to understand better the attentional abilities of intellectually gifted children. Specifically, we examined whether intellectually gifted children were more able to avoid IB while performing well on certain attentional tasks. An experiment was carried out that involved 44 intellectually gifted and 45 average children. Results showed that intellectually gifted children, whose IB rate was 18.6%, were less susceptible to IB than average children, whose IB rate was 46.5%, (2)(1) = 7.626, p = .006. Intellectually gifted children performed better on the primary attentional tasks than average children when unexpected stimuli occurred. Findings suggest that intellectually gifted children are more likely to maintain attention on current task but are more prone to process additional stimuli. Overall, the present study argues that general intelligence may affect IB."
101,2016.0,Hidden in Plain Sight: The Experiences of Three Twice-Exceptional Students During Their Transfer to High School,"Hidden in Plain Sight: The Experiences of Three Twice-Exceptional Students During Their Transfer to High School twice-exceptional; qualitative; transfer experiences; transition; capability approach Twice-exceptional students are characterized by the almost paradoxical combination of giftedness accompanied by learning difficulties that hinder their ability to reach their potential in a traditional academic setting. This qualitative study examined the experiences of three twice-exceptional students during transfer to a New Zealand high school. Successful transfer has been shown to be dependent on factors such as the timely handover of accurate and complete student records. Barriers to successful transfer result in disruption in curriculum continuity, which can be especially detrimental for learners with special needs. Using student voice data from interviews and journal entries, the participants' lived experiences of the transfer process were revealed. Findings suggest that the way in which the twice-exceptional students experienced transfer influenced the development of their personal capabilities as learners in the education setting."
102,2016.0,Giftedness and Overexcitability: Investigating the Relationship Using Meta-Analysis,"Giftedness and Overexcitability: Investigating the Relationship Using Meta-Analysis overexcitability; giftedness; Dabrowski; meta-analysis; research synthesis; systematic review Current textbooks, websites, research articles, and popular resources have stated that gifted individuals have longer and more pronounced responses to stimuli than the general population. This overexcitable nature of gifted persons has provided a commonly used lens to conceptualize, identify, and understand giftedness and gifted persons' behaviors. Yet there are reasons to be skeptical about the evidence demonstrating that the gifted population is more overexcitable than the nongifted population. A meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the existence and strength of the giftedness-overexcitability (OE) relationship as presented in a number of studies comparing the OE scores of intellectually gifted and nongifted samples. Gifted samples were found to have higher mean OE scores than nongifted samples. However, the effect size for psychomotor OE was not statistically significant, while the effect sizes for the emotional and sensual OEs were small. Calculated effect sizes for intellectual and imaginational OEs were medium. A number of important limitations and implications exist."
103,2016.0,"RETRACTED: Effects of Violent Media on Verbal Task Performance in Gifted and General Cohort Children(Retracted article. See vol. 61, pg. 153, 2017)","RETRACTED: Effects of Violent Media on Verbal Task Performance in Gifted and General Cohort Children(Retracted article. See vol. 61, pg. 153, 2017) violent media; giftedness; IQ; sensitivity; verbal task performance Violent media immediately grab our attention. However, violent media also detract attention from other cues. A large body of research shows that violent media impair attention and memory, critical resources for academic performance, such as verbal tasks at school. The present study tested whether gifted children are more insulated or more vulnerable to these violent media effects. Gifted (n = 74) and general cohort (n = 80) 10-year-old children were randomly assigned to watch a 12-minute violent or nonviolent cartoon. A verbal task was completed before and after the video. Results showed that gifted children outperformed general cohort children on the verbal task after watching a nonviolent cartoon, but not after watching a violent cartoon. Thus, the violent video eliminated the typical advantage gifted children have on verbal tasks. These findings suggest that the harmful effects of violent media on verbal tasks are greater for gifted children than for general cohort children."
104,2016.0,Equity and Excellence: Proactive Efforts in the Identification of Underrepresented Students for Gifted and Talented Services,"Equity and Excellence: Proactive Efforts in the Identification of Underrepresented Students for Gifted and Talented Services identification; underrepresentation; assessment; theoretical definitions The identification of gifted and talented students and the accompanying fact that most identification systems result in the underrepresentation of students from African American, Hispanic, Native American, English language learning, and low-income families are two of the most discussed and hotly debated topics in the field. This article provides an overview of past efforts to mitigate inequity in both K-12 and higher education program identification, highlights successes and limitations, and presents a particular perspective in order to help facilitate broader thinking about the purpose of identification, the development of talent, and how academic excellence can be fostered while simultaneously increasing equity in gifted education."
105,2016.0,Drawing Upon Lessons Learned: Effective Curriculum and Instruction for Culturally and Linguistically Diverse Gifted Learners,"Drawing Upon Lessons Learned: Effective Curriculum and Instruction for Culturally and Linguistically Diverse Gifted Learners curriculum; qualitative methodologies; special populations/underserved; gifted Javits Gifted and Talented Education Program has provided a wealth of knowledge on culturally and linguistically diverse (CLD) gifted learners and how to support teachers in their work with CLD students. This study examined five impactful Javits projects through qualitative inquiry centered on how innovative practice takes root or not. Using grounded theory tradition, examination of Javits project participation enabled insight into how educators act and react to innovation as well as their perceptions of CLD student impacts. Data sources (documents, conversations with principal investigators, and interviews with 14 educators) provide evidence for what sustains effective, research-based practices and explores continued student benefits. Major findings are (a) context matters in sustaining innovation, (b) powerful curriculum and instruction can transform teaching and teachers, and (c) student impacts continue. Data point to leadership as an underlying element in sustaining innovation. Leaders ensure that innovation extends from broad-based goals; they develop innovation through scale-up and involvement of others; they purposefully track results. Growing effective approaches is critical to access and opportunity and CLD-gifted learners' talent development."
106,2016.0,Openness to Experience Rather Than Overexcitabilities: Call It Like It Is,"Openness to Experience Rather Than Overexcitabilities: Call It Like It Is openness to experience; overexcitabilities; five-factor model of personality; structural equation modeling; quantitative methodologies; social and/or emotional development and adjustment Openness to experience is a personality factor in the five-factor model of personality, and it is composed of six facets. Facets of openness appear conceptually analogous to overexcitabilities (OEs), which are displays of inner energy guiding individuals toward advanced potential according to the theory of positive disintegration. This study examined the similarity of OEs to corresponding openness to experience facets in a sample of 149 creative adolescents and adults and 312 adults from the general population (total N = 461). Exploratory structural equation modeling tested competing models in which each OE and corresponding openness facet were modeled as separate factors and as joint factors. The separate-factor model had acceptable fit but uninterpretable loadings, while the joint-factor model had acceptable fit and interpretable loadings; thus, openness seems to encompass OEs. Accordingly, the field should align with well-researched psychological theories like the five-factor model of personality and begin to talk about openness rather than OEs."
107,2016.0,Teachers' Conceptions of Gifted and Average-Ability Students on Achievement-Relevant Dimensions,"Teachers' Conceptions of Gifted and Average-Ability Students on Achievement-Relevant Dimensions teachers' subjective theories; harmony hypothesis; disharmony hypothesis; definition and/or conception of giftedness/talent; vignettes; professional development; multivariate analyses Stereotyping of gifted students may not only hinder identification and actualization of potential but also personality development (stigma of giftedness). This is obvious in the case of negative stereotyping (e.g., the disharmony hypothesis, which sees gifted students as intellectually strong, but emotionally and socially inferior), but even overly positive stereotypes (e.g., the harmony hypothesis, which sees gifted students as superior in all respects) may prove harmful in that they put gifted students under pressure. In this study, we examined whether teachers' conceptions of the gifted are in line with either of these stereotypes. In a between-subjects design using vignettes, 246 German teachers rated fictitious students varying in ability level (gifted/average), gender (girl/boy), and age (8/15 years) on intellectual ability, motivation, prosociality, and maladjustment. Strong measurement invariance across vignette types was demonstrated for all dimensions. A repeated-measures analysis of variance of latent factor scores of the four dimensions showed that teachers considered gifted students more able, but less prosocial and more maladjusted than average-ability students. Whereas higher intellectual ability is in line with empirical findings about the gifted, lower social ability and higher maladjustment are not. Implications for theory, research, and educational practice are discussed."
108,2016.0,The Aurora-a Battery as an Assessment of Triarchic Intellectual Abilities in Upper Primary Grades,"The Aurora-a Battery as an Assessment of Triarchic Intellectual Abilities in Upper Primary Grades assessment; factor analysis; quantitative methodologies; elementary; age/developmental stage; creativity; programming/service delivery models The theory of triarchic intelligence posits that, in addition to the widely acknowledged analytical reasoning abilities, creative and practical abilities should be included in the assessments of intellectual capacities and identification of gifted students. To find support for such an approach, the present study examined the psychometric properties of the Aurora-a Assessment Battery of triarchic abilities in the upper primary grades. To assess the dimensional structure of the Aurora-a Assessment Battery, we analyzed subtest scores of 499 elementary school children. Correlational and factor analyses showed a poor fit between Aurora-a subtest scores and the triarchic theory of intelligence, indicating deficiencies in either the triarchic theory or the design of the Aurora-a Battery. Researchers should sustain their current efforts to evaluate the validity of various theories of intelligence and to develop theory-based assessment instruments."

Some gifted identification guidelines allow for the interchangeable use of performance and nonperformance identification methods. This multiple criteria approach lacks a strong overlap between the assessment tools; however, interchangeable use of the instruments (replacing one for another) entails high regularity. This meta-analytic review investigated the consistency of using performance and nonperformance identification methods by examining the influence of three moderators in two different study analyses. Study 1 focused on correlational and comparison studies by using Pearson r as the index of effect size within a three-level multilevel design. Study 2 was conducted with three diagnostic proportional metrics: efficiency, effectiveness/sensitivity, and specificity. Results from Study 1 indicated the overall correlation between the performance and nonperformance gifted identification methods was medium (r = .30). Teacher ratings yielded significantly higher consistency with performance measures than teacher or parent nomination and self-ratings. Study 2 showed that nonperformance methods are relatively strong in terms of specificity (70%) and effectiveness/sensitivity (59%) but not very efficient (39%). Analyses of four diagnostic quadrants indicated that performance and nonperformance gifted identification methods, when used alone, tend to identify different students who would not be identified otherwise despite some amount of convergence between the two. Our findings indicated that nonperformance and performance gifted identification methods cannot replace each other. They should be used concurrently rather than be used alone or consecutively."
111,2016.0,A Meta-Analysis of the Effects of Enrichment Programs on Gifted Students,"A Meta-Analysis of the Effects of Enrichment Programs on Gifted Students meta-analysis; enrichment programs; gifted students; evaluation Although descriptions of enrichment programs are valuable for practitioners, practices, and services for gifted students, they must be backed by evidence, derived through a synthesis of research. This study examined research on enrichment programs serving gifted students and synthesized the current studies between 1985 and 2014 on the effects of enrichment programs. A total of 26 studies were included in this meta-analysis, and the findings show that enrichment programs had a positive impact on both gifted students' academic achievement (g = 0.96, 95% CI [0.64, 1.30], under a random-effects model) and socioemotional development (g = 0.55, 95% CI [0.32, 0.79], under a random-effects model). Regarding moderators of the effects, types of programs, and grade levels influenced both effect sizes of academic achievement and socioemotional development. The largest effect size was observed for summer residential programs in terms of academic achievement and for a combination of summer and academic year program in terms of socioemotional development."

Yet there is a lack of evidence regarding the relationship between common psychopathologies and indicators of little-c, or every day, creativity among laypeople. To make sense of this connection, we conducted a meta-analysis using 89 studies to reveal the overall relationships between the most common psychopathologies and little-c creativity and uncover the source of variance in the relationships. The 89 studies involved 35,271 participants and the common psychopathologies: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, and depression. Results indicated that the overall mean effect size was not different from zero (r = -.06, k = 261, 95% confidence interval [-.15, .02]) with substantial heterogeneity. Variability of effect sizes was examined by five moderators: assessment of psychopathology, assessment of creativity, age, gender, and intelligence of participants. Specifically, the moderator analyses showed that effect sizes varied by assessment of both psychopathology and creativity as well as level of intelligence."

Specifically, we discuss issues such as how to select a topic and formulate research problems, search for and identify qualified studies, code studies and extract data, choose and calculate effect sizes, analyze data, conduct heterogeneity and moderator analysis, assess publication bias, as well as interpret and report meta-analysis results. We discuss why meta-analysis is needed in gifted education. We also review the history of meta-analyses in gifted education and discuss topics that are conducive to meta-analysis. Furthermore, we provide an overview of the challenges and recent advancements in meta-analysis methodology. Last, we introduce useful resources for further learning of meta-analysis."

Confidence in writing increased across time within three courses, whereas approach to writing did not. Differences were found between genders and between students taking different courses. In the writing process class, girls scored higher in their approach to writing at the end of class than boys. Girls obtained higher final grades than boys, but girls who had higher change in approach to writing obtained higher final grades than (a) boys who reported a higher change and (b) both boys and girls who reported less change. A unique association may exist between talented students' gender and change in self-efficacy on final course grade."

This learner was selected on the assumption that drawing attention to the characteristics of a successful learner may improve learning effectiveness of less successful learners. The first author taught the gifted learner and collected data through participant observation over a 3-year period when the learner was in Grades 8 to 10. The data corpus was composed of audio-recorded lesson observations and interviews, field notes, and written material. We operated in an interpretive paradigm, and data collection, analysis, and interpretation were done in an inductive, cyclic manner associated with the constant comparative method. We identified three general strategies and a number of associated tactics that characterized his successful learning. These strategies are interrogating information, thinking it through, and organizing and linking."
116,2016.0,Five Reasons to Put the g Back Into Giftedness: An Argument for Applying the Cattell-Horn-Carroll Theory of Intelligence to Gifted Education Research and Practice,"Five Reasons to Put the g Back Into Giftedness: An Argument for Applying the Cattell-Horn-Carroll Theory of Intelligence to Gifted Education Research and Practice definition and/or conception of giftedness/talent; differentiation; human intelligence; philosophical/theoretical Human intelligence (also called general intelligence, g, or Spearman's g) is a highly useful psychological construct. Yet, since the middle of the 20th century, gifted education researchers have been reluctant to discuss human intelligence. The purpose of this article is to persuade gifted education researchers and practitioners to reincorporate modern human intelligence theory (as expressed in Cattell-Horn-Carroll, or CHC, theory) and research into their work on gifted children. There are five reasons to make intelligence part of gifted education research: (a) intelligence is one of the best studied constructs in psychology; (b) educators know more about how to adjust educational plans in response to intelligence than many other traits; (c) grounding research in CHC theory strengthens the links between gifted education and psychology, making gifted education more relevant to outsiders; (d) intelligence is an excellent predictor of long-term general life outcomes; and (e) many issues in gifted education (such as curriculum planning and underidentification) are best understood if considered in relation to intelligence and related cognitive abilities. The article ends with some caveats that gifted education researchers should keep in mind when integrating human intelligence research and CHC theory into their work."
117,2016.0,The Psychological Well-Being of Early Identified Gifted Children,"The Psychological Well-Being of Early Identified Gifted Children gifted; identification; intelligence; creativity; psychological well-being This study examined the psychological well-being of gifted primary school children. From a screening sample of 233 children in Grades 1 and 2 across five schools in the Netherlands, 35 children achieving high scores on two out of three selection criteria (teacher nomination, creativity, and nonverbal reasoning ability) and 34 typically developing children were selected to participate in the study. Combinations of grouping criteria were used to create different subsamples within the gifted sample. In general, the differences in well-being between the gifted and the comparison group were relatively small, although the gifted children experienced lower self-worth and social acceptance. In contrast, within the sample of gifted children, some differences were found between selected subgroups. Highly creative gifted children experienced lower feelings of well-being than less creative gifted children, while the reverse was true for children who were nominated by their teacher. Additionally, high-performing gifted children showed higher psychological well-being than underachievers."

Quantitative research has shown acceleration to be a highly successful intervention regarding academic achievement, but less is known about the social-emotional outcomes of grade-skipping. In the present study, the authors used the grounded theory approach to examine the experiences of seven gifted students aged 8 to 16 years who skipped a grade. The interviewees perceived their feeling of being in the wrong place before the grade-skipping as strongly influenced by their teachers, who generally did not respond adequately to their needs. We observed a close interrelationship between the gifted students' intellectual fit and their social situation in class. Findings showed that the grade-skipping in most of the cases bettered the situation in school intellectually as well as socially, but soon further interventions, for instance, a specialized and demanding class- or subject-specific acceleration were added to provide sufficiently challenging learning opportunities."

The study used data from 533 high-ability American college students: honors students and participants in an early college entrance program. In earlier studies using the PWI-A, the instrument appeared to show differences in disaggregated aspects of well-being for these gifted college students. Unfortunately, the careful psychometric examination of the instrument done in this study showed that the PWI-A, as it currently is constituted, did not perform as hoped for assessing changes in the disaggregated aspects of well-being among groups of gifted college students. The single-factor structure of PWI-A showed support for convergent validity, but error correlations indicated lack of support for discriminant validity. The current analysis of the PWI-A scores showed good internal consistency, but the instrument lacked measurement invariance across honors and early entrance students. Four of the seven items exhibited differential item functioning across the two groups. The lack of full measurement invariance indicated room for refinement of the instrument as applied to measuring the well-being of high-ability college students. The results of the current study suggest that to measure accurately the disaggregated well-being of gifted and talented young people, a new, revised, or expanded instrument is necessary. More and diverse items per subscale in a new or revised instrument would allow a more accurate assessment of the specific aspects of the well-being of gifted and talented individuals."

However, acceleration is underutilized and little is known about students' motivations to accelerate. In this study, 21 high-ability high school students in Grades 11 and 12 took part in a structured conceptualization exercise that revealed why they chose to concurrently enroll in university courses. Participants brainstormed responses to a focus prompt, then structured the data by sorting and rating their responses. The structured data were analyzed using multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis to produce a cluster map of participants' motivations. In order of importance, key concepts included (a) university preparation, (b) demonstrating initiative, (c) getting ahead, (d) love of learning, (e) self-fulfillment, (f) seeking challenge, and (g) socializing. The key concepts were examined within a self-determination theory framework. Study findings provide a deeper understanding of high-achieving students' views on concurrent enrollment. Educational and research implications are discussed."

Thirteen parents were interviewed and the interviews were transcribed and qualitatively analyzed. This article specifically examines the parents' experiences navigating the educational system for their children. All participants described the challenges associated with finding appropriate educational placements for their children due to the children's unique social and academic needs. Parents recognized the incompatibility between their child's characteristics and typical educational environments, and this incompatibility required parents to take an active role in designing and finding appropriate educational opportunities. These findings provide insight for school personnel and parents as they develop flexible services for twice-exceptional students."

Twenty-four graduates of the high school's gifted program completed a confidential survey and participated in one-on-one interviews. The participants identified the most valuable learning experience as the independent study course; they reported that the independent study course influenced their choice of college major and positively affected their studies in their senior year of college. Most participants valued their overall academic experience in the self-contained program, although a few reported that they were unable to learn so many science-related subjects simultaneously at such a fast pace, suggesting that this type of program needs to be differentiated. The social impacts of the program varied. Implications of the findings for educators as well as suggestions for future research are discussed."
123,2015.0,Gifted Students' Implicit Beliefs About Intelligence and Giftedness,"Gifted Students' Implicit Beliefs About Intelligence and Giftedness giftedness; implicit beliefs; intelligence Growing attention is being paid to individuals' implicit beliefs about the nature of intelligence. However, implicit beliefs about giftedness are currently underexamined. In the current study, we examined academically gifted adolescents' implicit beliefs about both intelligence and giftedness. Overall, participants' implicit beliefs about giftedness and intelligence were significantly positively correlated while also having statistically significant mean differences, suggesting that they perceived the nature of the two constructs differently. Specifically, many students viewed intelligence as malleable (incremental view) and giftedness as fixed (entity view), whereas very few students viewed giftedness as malleable and intelligence as fixed; however, heterogeneity was observed. The beliefs identified in the current study provide important insight into the domain-specific nature of implicit beliefs of gifted students and suggest that caution be used against using terms like giftedness and intelligence interchangeably."

Despite a slew of provocative book titles regarding gifted adults in the mainstream media, and the inclusion of the notion of giftedness among adults in the definition of giftedness proposed by Subotnik, Olszewski-Kubilius, and Worrell, there is a limited amount of research that has examined the gifted adult. In this systematic review of the literature, we categorized the available research literature into nine thematic areas: (a) whether or not gifted children become gifted adults; (b) family of origin; (c) effects of early educational experiences; (d) characteristics of gifted adults; (e) career; (f) family of procreation; (g) career and family interaction; (h) life goals, satisfaction, and well-being; and (i) counseling. Implications for gifted adults and the field of gifted education are discussed."
125,2015.0,Gifted Students' Perceptions of an Accelerated Summer Program and Social Support,"Gifted Students' Perceptions of an Accelerated Summer Program and Social Support social and; or emotional development and adjustment; multivariate analyses; secondary Using survey responses from students who participated in the summer programs at two university-based gifted education institutions, this study examined changes in gifted students' perceptions of their learning environments, accelerated summer programs and regular schools, and social support in lives after participation in the summer programs. Our sample of gifted students was generally favorable about their classroom experiences and interactions with their teachers both in the gifted programs and regular school classes. Some noticeable differences were greater acceptance and support for giftedness, a stronger connection to peers, and greater ease in peer relationships reported during the programs, and enhanced maturity and orientation toward future after the programs. While all students relied on family and peers as sources of social support before, during and after the summer programs, older students also endorsed being able to rely more on themselves. Perceptions of greater social support seemed to be related to more positive assessment of students' summer and school classes, although causality can go in either direction. Overall, this study suggests that gifted students' summer program experiences may be instrumental in receiving affirmation about their giftedness from peers, enhancing independence and maturity for academic life, and building stronger belief in themselves."

Broadly defined, replication is the duplication of previously conducted research to verify or expand the original findings. Replication is particularly useful in the gifted education context because so much education theory and research are based on general education students and environments; the extent to which this prior work extends to gifted education contexts needs to be evaluated. The rationale, definition, implementation methods, and current state of replication in the social sciences generally, as well as in giftedness and creativity research specifically, are reviewed. Finally, guidance for conducting replications is provided, including recommendations on selecting important topics, engaging original authors, ensuring sufficient power, using appropriate measures and analyses, framing the manuscript, and submission planning."

Focusing on the last attribute, this study examined the following: (a) the criteria which expert mathematicians and mathematically gifted students fleshed out to identify their own most preferred mathematics problem-solving approaches and (b) the extent to which students perceived expert mathematicians' preferences for one approach over the others as aesthetically pleasing. The findings suggested that: (a) unlike expert mathematicians who saw beauty in mathematics as an exhaustive consequence of simplicity and originality, mathematically gifted students found mathematical elegance only in approaches that were efficient in terms of time and number of steps to solve the problems and (b) although expert mathematicians considered mathematically gifted students' most preferred approaches to be the least beautiful, mathematically gifted students, showing no enthusiasm, considered expert mathematicians' most preferred approaches to be no more attractive than their own approaches."

Toward this end, the current study explored how academically talented students from the United States and India spend their time both in and out of school. Indian students reported spending roughly 11 more hours on academics than their U.S. peers during the weekend in both STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) and non-STEM topics. U.S. students reported spending about 5.4 more hours than their Indian peers on non-STEM academics during the week, leaving an approximately 7-hour-a-week academic gap between U.S. and Indian students. Additionally, U.S. students reported using electronics over 14 hours per week more than their Indian peers. Indian students also reported having control over a greater proportion of their time during the week than U.S. students did. Generally, there were far more cross-cultural differences than gender differences. These results inform discussions on how academically talented students develop within educational systems as well as what each culture supports in and out of school."
129,2015.0,Using Design-Based Research in Gifted Education,"Using Design-Based Research in Gifted Education design-based research; process-oriented; context-sensitive Design-based research (DBR) is a new methodological framework that was developed in the context of the learning sciences; however, it has not been used very often in the field of gifted education. Compared with other methodologies, DBR is more process-oriented and context-sensitive. In this methodological brief, the authors introduce DBR and explain why it can be useful to researchers in the field of gifted education. The authors give an overview of the history and the key features of DBR, then discuss the challenges of using DBR. Based on both the literature and the authors' experiences using DBR as a framework in their own empirical studies, suggestions are provided to help gifted education researchers who would like to use DBR."
130,2015.0,The Reciprocal Effects Model Revisited: Extending Its Reach to Gifted Students Attending Academically Selective Schools,"The Reciprocal Effects Model Revisited: Extending Its Reach to Gifted Students Attending Academically Selective Schools reciprocal effects model; selective education; academic self-concept; academic achievement; gifted students The reciprocal effects model (REM) predicts a reciprocal relation between academic self-concept and academic achievement, whereby prior academic self-concept is associated with future gains in achievement, and prior achievement is related to subsequent academic self-concept. Although research in this area has been extensive, there has been a paucity of research specifically examining the REM from the standpoint of students who attend academically selective schools. The present research aimed to rectify this gap in the literature by testing the equivalence of the REM across a sample of high school students who attend both academically selective (n = 738) and mixed-ability comprehensive (n = 2,048) schools. Multigroup analyses revealed that the REM existed for both groups and that there were no differences between the groups in either the size or the direction of the paths that constitute the REM. Implications for REM theory and teaching practice are discussed."
131,2015.0,Cope and Grow: A Grounded Theory Approach to Early College Entrants' Lived Experiences and Changes in a STEM Program,"Cope and Grow: A Grounded Theory Approach to Early College Entrants' Lived Experiences and Changes in a STEM Program qualitative methodologies; social and; or emotional development and adjustment; student motivation In this grounded theory qualitative study, we interviewed 34 graduates from one cohort of 51 students from a prestigious early college entrance program in China. Based on the interview data, we identified distinct convergent and divergent patterns of lived experiences and changes. We found several dominant themes, including peers' mutual stimulation for excellence, academic competition, big-fish-little-pond effect, coping with academic challenges, transition to college life, developing intrinsic interests, and making critical career decisions. Based on the thematic analysis, we developed a Cope-and-Grow model of strivings for academic excellence while developing one's self-identity. Three interrelated claims are made about the unique situation in which early college entrants found themselves, individual differences in coping and growing experiences, and intrapersonal changes over time. Rich connections are made between the Cope-and-Grow model and the extant empirical research and theories, such as aptitude theory, developmental asynchrony theory, and talent development theory. We also discussed the implications of the findings for curricular and instructional adaptation, counseling interventions, and future research."
132,2015.0,Effects of Differentiated Reading on Elementary Students' Reading Comprehension and Attitudes Toward Reading,"Effects of Differentiated Reading on Elementary Students' Reading Comprehension and Attitudes Toward Reading differentiation; Schoolwide Enrichment Model-Reading; Title I; reading comprehension In this investigation, we examined the effects of a differentiated reading approach on fourth grade students' reading comprehension and attitudes toward reading. Eight Title I schools within one urban district were randomly assigned to treatment (Schoolwide Enrichment Model-Reading [SEM-R]) or control (district reading curriculum) conditions. Treatment teachers implemented SEM-R as a supplement to the district curriculum for 1 academic year, whereas control teachers used the district curriculum. Based on multilevel analyses of students' posttest reading comprehension scores on the Iowa Test of Basic Skills (n = 358) and attitudes toward reading as measured by the Elementary Reading Attitudes Survey (n = 429), no statistically significant differences in students' attitudes toward reading were found, but SEM-R students had significantly higher scores on the comprehension posttest compared with the students in the control schools."
133,2015.0,"The Advocacy Experiences of Parents of Elementary Age, Twice-Exceptional Children","The Advocacy Experiences of Parents of Elementary Age, Twice-Exceptional Children twice exceptional; special populations/underserved gifted; special populations/underserved gifted; parents For many parents, successfully advocating for their twice-exceptional child can be intimidating and overwhelming. Using grounded theory, we conducted a study with parents (n = 8) of elementary age, twice-exceptional children to learn about their advocacy experiences. Findings revealed that parents simultaneously advocated for their child's disability and protected their child's giftedness. This overarching theme influenced parents' expectations of their local school system, while highlighting their lack of professional knowledge. All participants wanted their child to maximize her or his potential and not be limited by her or his disability. Data gathered from individual interviews and focus group sessions revealed that all parents struggled with developing advocacy strategies to manage their child's dual diagnosis. Only after parents acquired professional knowledge about educational terminology and official policies, were they able to become successful advocates. The lack of readily available resources focusing on twice-exceptional children was an obstacle to successful advocacy. Suggestions for future research and collaboration are discussed."
134,2015.0,Even the Best Have Difficulties: A Study of Finnish Straight-A Graduates' Resource-Oriented Solutions,"Even the Best Have Difficulties: A Study of Finnish Straight-A Graduates' Resource-Oriented Solutions academic achievement; straight-A student; difficulties in studies; graduate; grades To achieve top scores, students need not only talents and study skills but also they have to conquer various adversities successfully. This research focused on the study paths, the concept adopted from Hickman, Bartholomew, Mathwig, and Heinrich (2008), of Finnish straight-A graduates in general upper secondary education. In this article, we refer to these paths with the concepts of study processes or just studies. The purpose was to analyze what kinds of difficulties these graduates had faced and how they coped with them. Researchers gathered data from 14 Finnish straight-A graduates by mailing a request to write an essay and by interviewing them. The results showed how the graduates' core difficulties were related to their peer relationships because of the gifted students' standing out from the crowd, pressure set by their own ambition, and the burden of wide-ranging interests. The graduates seemed to employ resource-oriented solutions when coping with adversities and difficultiesin this study, the solutions were divided into three dimensions. Based on the results, it is relevant to ask whether schools could support gifted students better by allowing mistakes and failures and supporting students to confront adversities by providing models and tools for survival. It is important to emphasize that failures and adversities are not a sign of weakness."
135,2015.0,Life in the Fast Lane: Effects of Early Grade Acceleration on High School and College Outcomes,"Life in the Fast Lane: Effects of Early Grade Acceleration on High School and College Outcomes acceleration; gifted; grade skipping; college outcomes; longitudinal analysis Research has repeatedly demonstrated the positive effects of acceleration for gifted and talented students. This study expands the literature by not only evaluating the impact of early grade skipping on high school and college outcomes but also examining the role of postacceleration opportunities on subsequent performance. Using a representative national sample, accelerated students were compared with older grade-level peers who had similar academic and demographic backgrounds. Results suggest that, on average, accelerated students consistently and significantly outperformed their nonaccelerated peers, both in high school and in college. Furthermore, postacceleration educational opportunities provided additional benefit; students who skipped a grade and also participated in challenging academic programs (e.g., Advanced Placement, high-ability instructional groups) demonstrated particularly high achievement. Results suggest that gifted learners profit most when acceleration is coupled with additional opportunities for advanced study."
136,2015.0,Birthdate Effects and Gifted Program Participation in Kindergarten,"Birthdate Effects and Gifted Program Participation in Kindergarten birthdate effects; gifted identification; kindergarten entry age Research has suggested that relatively older children are more likely to be identified as gifted and talented students compared with their younger peers. Such a phenomenon disadvantages the youngest students while at the same time confers additional advantages to the older students as a result of receiving specialized and/or extra instruction. The current study investigated the presence of this phenomenon on a national level using the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Cohort. Data were analyzed using multiple logistic regression analyses that accounted for the nested structure of the data and included student demographic variables as well as academic achievement skills as controls. Findings showed that even though a weak correlation indicated that relatively older students, on average, were more likely to be in a gifted and talented program, the association disappeared once academic achievement skills were accounted for."

Although advanced coursework may provide a unique context for the development of friendships, more research is needed to explore exactly what differences exist. Using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health and the Adolescent Health and Academic Achievement Study, we compared the friendship networks of students taking advanced mathematics and English coursework to those of similar nonparticipants. Groups were compared on the number of sent or received nominations based on students' listings of friends, the presence and reciprocation of best friendships, and friends' academic engagement and diversity. Controlling for background, advanced coursework participants had larger networks and more engaged friends than did nonparticipants. Small differences in age heterogeneity and in the likelihood of reciprocal best friendships with female friends were found in English course-taking. Participants' networks were also somewhat less racially diverse."
138,2015.0,Psychometric Properties of the School Attitude Assessment Survey-Revised With International Baccalaureate High School Students,"Psychometric Properties of the School Attitude Assessment Survey-Revised With International Baccalaureate High School Students International Baccalaureate; confirmatory factor analysis In two studies (ns = 312 and 1,149) with 9- to 12-grade students in pre-International Baccalaureate (IB) and IB Diploma programs, we evaluated the reliability, factor structure, measurement invariance, and criterion-related validity of the scores from the School Attitude Assessment Survey-Revised (SAAS-R). Reliabilities of the five SAAS-R subscale scores were good (s > .80) for pre-IB (Grades 9-10) and IB students (Grades 11-12). Study 1 model fit indices for the five-factor SAAS-R model from confirmatory factor analyses showed greater misfit than those previously reported by McCoach and Siegle. In contrast, Study 2 fit indices for the five-factor model with pre-IB and IB students were similar to values reported by McCoach and Siegle. Tests of measurement invariance in Study 2 using multigroup confirmatory factor analysis identified three items within the Motivation/Self-Regulation subscale that differed in their item intercepts (i.e., uniform differential item functioning) with pre-IB students endorsing these items more strongly compared with IB students. Based on these results along with evidence of criterion-related validity as reflected in the moderate statistical relations between the SAAS-R subscales and students' GPAs, the SAAS-R shows promise as a research tool that can be used to examine the psychological factors associated with pre-IB and IB students' academic achievement."
139,2015.0,"Childhood Giftedness, Adolescent Agency: A Systemic Multiple-Case Study","Childhood Giftedness, Adolescent Agency: A Systemic Multiple-Case Study gifted; talented; child; development; motivation; adolescence; sensemaking; qualitative; parent; teacher Although considerable research has addressed development from childhood giftedness to adult excellence, subjective perceptions of this development by gifted individuals themselves have remained largely unexplored. This multiple case study examined the ways in which young adults, who in the past had been identified as gifted, made sense of their giftedness based on cues obtained from their social environment and the impact of this sensemaking on their development. Some participants made sense of their giftedness in a way that prevented them from developing a sense of agency in their education: Their sensemaking was based on social control or, conversely, on effortless learning and easy victories they experienced in childhood. The participants who showed the highest level of achievement and motivation in early adulthood perceived themselves as agents of their learning and made sense of their extraordinary outcomes as resulting from effortful, proper, and self-directed practice. Our findings indicate that a sense of agency is critical to maintaining gifted-level achievement through adolescence. We have identified some of the social environment factors that can diminish or enhance that sense of agency in high-achieving children."

Surveys completed by 241 Australian preservice teachers were analyzed using confirmatory factor analyses and multiple regression analyses. The findings suggest that (a) low power distance orientation, contact with gifted persons, and older age predict support for special gifted programs/provisions and (b) the lack of prior experience of an advanced/extended curriculum in a regular classroom and younger age predict the perception that special gifted programs/provisions are elitist."
142,2014.0,Social Understanding of High-Ability Children in Middle and Late Childhood,"Social Understanding of High-Ability Children in Middle and Late Childhood high-ability children; theory of mind; perception accuracy; cognitive ability; peer acceptance Despite its importance in social development, social understanding has hardly been studied in high-ability children. This study explores differences in social understanding between children in high-ability and regular classrooms, specifically theory of mind (ToM) and perception accuracy, as well as associations between individual characteristics (age, gender, peer acceptance, and cognitive ability) and social understanding. Participants were 671 children in Grades 1 to 6 (55% boys; M age 9.20 years). Children in high-ability classrooms had higher ToM scores in Grades 1 to 3 and were more accurate perceivers of acceptance than children in regular classrooms. No group differences were found for ToM in Grades 4 to 6. ToM was associated with several individual characteristics, in particular age and cognitive ability. Perception accuracy was mainly related to peer acceptance. Suggestions for future research and implications for practitioners are discussed."
143,2014.0,Evaluating the Efficacy of Using Predifferentiated and Enriched Mathematics Curricula for Grade 3 Students: A Multisite Cluster-Randomized Trial,"Evaluating the Efficacy of Using Predifferentiated and Enriched Mathematics Curricula for Grade 3 Students: A Multisite Cluster-Randomized Trial mathematics; differentiated curricula; enriched curricula; Grade 3 students; multilevel model; cluster randomized trial Despite the potential of differentiated curricula to enhance learning, limited research exists that documents their impact on Grade 3 students of all ability levels. To determine if there was a difference in achievement between students involved in 16 weeks of predifferentiated, enriched mathematics curricula and students using their district's curricula, we conducted a multisite cluster-randomized control trial with 43 schools in 12 states. A series of three-level models, using pre- and postachievement test data, failed to show a main effect for treatment, but the results suggested a treatment by achievement-level interaction that was moderated by the achievement level of the school. As a result, the highest achieving students in the lower achieving schools seemed to receive the greatest benefit from the treatment curricula. An analysis of researcher-developed unit tests revealed that treatment students successfully learned and applied the curricula's challenging mathematics. Thus, using the predifferentiated and enriched mathematics curricula with heterogeneous ability students appeared to do no harm-students who completed the treatment curricula did as well as their control counterparts, on average. Evidence of its achievement-related benefits is more ambiguous; however, the findings do suggest some benefits for the highest achieving students in lower achieving schools."
144,2014.0,Implementing Enrichment Clusters in Elementary Schools: Lessons Learned,"Implementing Enrichment Clusters in Elementary Schools: Lessons Learned Schoolwide Enrichment Model; enrichment clusters; Renzulli; authentic learning Enrichment clusters offer a way for schools to encourage a high level of learning as students and adults work together to develop a product, service, or performance by applying advanced knowledge and authentic processes to real-world problems. This study utilized a qualitative research design to examine the perceptions and experiences of two enrichment specialists who led the implementation of enrichment clusters in their schools. The perceptions of the participants hold particular value, as the success of clusters depends heavily on the ability of the specialist to effectively plan and organize clusters so that they meet the needs of administrators, teachers, students, and parents. Findings indicated that the participants felt that clusters were worthwhile, despite the time and effort required for implementation. A number of factors were considered critical for the success of clusters, including time and money, teachers as facilitators, focusing on student interests, and planning for rules, routines, and procedures. In addition, the participants identified several ways in which clusters were adapted in order to meet the needs of the school. The study indicates implications, and limitations of these findings are also discussed."

Results indicated that volunteer experiences, which encourage students' selection of and active involvement with community-based projects, may positively affect Physical/Mental Energy. Also, allowing students face-to-face time with dissimilar volunteer recipients may positively affect Sensitivity to Others. Implications for educators and researchers are discussed."

Using a case study design, the researchers analyzed data collected from student and teacher interviews, parent focus groups, educational records, and psychological reports. Findings indicate areas of change and development across cognitive, emotional/behavioral, and social domains and identified five factors underlying student growth: psychological safety, tolerance for asynchrony, time, positive relationships, and the consistent use of a strengths-based, talent-focused philosophy. Data also revealed four benefits from the talent development opportunities offered by the school. Participating in talent development activities enabled students to become part of a social group; to overcome some social, emotional, and cognitive challenges in context; to develop ongoing mentor and professional relationships with people in talent areas; and to develop expertise in an area of talent. This research supports the incorporation of a strengths-based, talent-focused approach for twice-exceptional learners."

Although attempts have been made to develop interventions to reverse gifted underachievement, the theoretical underpinnings of these interventions have yet to be empirically validated. The purpose of this study was to investigate the validity of the Achievement-Orientation Model for gifted middle school students. Based on a sample of 156 gifted sixth- and seventh-grade mathematics students, results of the current study suggest two unique clusters of gifted students, those whose attitudes toward each of the model's constructs are positive and those who attitudes are not as positive. Furthermore, results of a path analysis demonstrate that most of the relationships posited by the model do appear to exist. The findings of this study suggest that the Achievement-Orientation Model may hold promise for the development of interventions to address gifted underachievement."

Most theories on talent development assume that a young artist would have access to the resources required for one to advance in the domain. The results of multiple in-depth interviews suggested that in the absence of such resources, there is an alternative pathway toward expertise in the musical domain. This pathway involves early exposure to music in the context of daily living, the active role played by the neighborhood and the entire community in nurturing the musical talent, and deliberate practice. The article also explores various motivations (both intrinsic and extrinsic) in developing musical expertise. The implications of the research findings to educators and practitioners are also discussed."

The study includes common neuropsychological tests associated with preliteracy and the early-reading process as well as markers for inattention and executive functioning skills. Using a sample of kindergarteners identified as gifted, the results indicated that despite intelligence quotient scores in the very superior range and high means on traditional achievement measures, great variability was observed within the sample on several benchmarking measures of cognitive, academic, neuropsychological, and executive functioning. Additionally, only an average mean score on a visual-motor processing neuropsychological measure was obtained. Four neuropsychological measures provided important loadings in canonical correlations with achievement: Oromotor Sequences, Repetition of Nonsense Words, Beery-Buktenica Developmental Test of Visual-Motor Integration scores, and Speeded Naming. In addition to providing baseline data on these measures, the results also offer support for defining giftedness as a developmental process."

Results from an online survey revealed that our gifted students rated their families as cohesive and flexible with high levels of satisfaction and communication among family members. Compared with students, parents identified their families as more intimate, cohesive, and flexible and felt more positively about communication among their family members. Students' ratings of their family were found to be good predictors of their interpersonal ability and peer relationships, and positive correlations were found between the students' social competence and their ratings of functional aspects of the family. Differences were also found by students' level of social competence, with students with higher levels of social competence rating their families more positively. Unlike the norming sample, rigidity was not endorsed as a negative family variable. The results of this study are consistent with previous research in that affectionate, supportive, and respectful family environments appear to be important to the development of interpersonal skills and competency and peer relationships for gifted individuals."

156,2014.0,Critical Thinking Skills Among Elementary School Students Comparing Identified Gifted and General Education Student Performance,"Critical Thinking Skills Among Elementary School Students Comparing Identified Gifted and General Education Student Performance differentiation; thinking skills; programming/service delivery models; critical thinking; cognition; learning Education reform efforts, including the current adoption of Common Core State Standards, have increased attention to teaching critical thinking skills to all students. This study investigated the critical thinking skills of fourth-grade students from a school district in Texas, including 45 identified gifted students and 163 general education students. Identified gifted students outperformed general education students on both the Cornell Critical Thinking Test and the Test of Critical Thinking (d = 1.52 and d = 1.36, respectively). There was no evidence of main effects or interaction effects for gender in measures of critical thinking within these samples. Critical thinking scores of students in the three schools did not differ significantly, nor were differences in scores associated with length of exposure to the gifted education program. The association of higher ability with advanced critical thinking skills, but at the same time, the lack of evidence of an effect of the gifted education programs (which did not focus specifically on critical thinking skills) suggests that differentiation of curriculum and instruction for gifted or advanced learners might fruitfully include deliberate differentiation of instruction in this area."

Although many educators and scholars have begun to pay more attention to unique issues associated with this population, studies exploring these students' experiences as honors students in collegiate contexts are scant in the educational literature. The purpose of this study is to explore high-achieving Asian American students' perceptions of their experiences in a collegiate honors program. Using an ecological framework, the authors explored four Asian American students' unique experiences as members of a collegiate honors program at a large university in the Midwest. Using consensual qualitative research as a methodological framework, six domains were found: (a) experiences in the honors program, (b) resources, (c) perceptions of ethnic identity, (d) career aspirations, (e) suggestions for gifted students, and (f) needs and hopes."
158,2014.0,Gifted Conversations Discursive Patterns in Gifted Classes,"Gifted Conversations Discursive Patterns in Gifted Classes discourse analysis; initiation-response-evaluation (IRE); dialogic discourse; classroom discourse; gifted education Despite the attested association between giftedness and high verbal abilities, and despite the central role attributed to classroom discourse analysis in educational research, discourse in gifted classes has not received due scholarly attention. This study takes a first step toward filling this gap. This study offers a microanalysis of a corpus of recorded and transcribed interactions from classes of gifted students in the Commonwealth of Virginia. This study focuses on student initiations and on the ways teachers handle these initiations. It is argued that the preponderance of student initiations in the classes observed sets a fertile ground for dialogic discourse to develop. However, student initiations do not guarantee the emergence of dialogic discourse, since teachers sometimes employ instructional practices that hinder its emergence."

This exploratory study used structural equation modeling to examine the contributions of the perceived level of difficulty of the curriculum, in addition to the contributions of social comparison and achievement in schoolwork, to academic self-concept among students enrolled in advanced coursework. Along with school achievement, perceived difficulty and social comparison also predicted academic self-concept. The final model indicated that students differentiate between learner self-concept, which is how students perceived their ability to understand new ideas or knowledge, and student self-concept, which is how they perceived their abilities to succeed in school-related tasks. Of these two constructs, student self-concept was a better predictor of future goals; however, the overall effect was small."

Although widely accepted in gifted education, above-level testing has not been subject to careful psychometric scrutiny. In this study, I examine reliability data, growth trajectories, distributions, and group differences of above-level test scores obtained from the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills and Iowa Tests of Educational Development. Two hundred twenty-four middle school students participated in this study. All participants were tested at least 1 time for an overall total of 435 times. Longitudinal analyses was performed with hierarchical linear modeling and indicated that substantial differences exist between students from overrepresented ethnicities (White and Asian Americans) and those from underrepresented ethnicities (Hispanic and African Americans) in both initial scores and the rate of score gains. Sex differences existed only for the rate of score increases for above-level reading scores. Socioeconomic differences existed but did not have a unique impact beyond that of the ethnicity variable. A discussion of these results within a wider gifted education context and suggestions for further research are included."

This study explored the impact of The Teacher's Observation of Potential in Students (TOPS) tool on teachers' ability to systematically observe and document the academic strengths of 5- to 9-year-old students across nine domains. Teachers indicated that without the TOPS, they would have overlooked the academic potential of 22% (1,741) of their children of color and 53% of African American boys, in particular. After using the TOPS, a majority of the teachers (74%) felt they could more readily recognize high-potential students from culturally or linguistically different and economically disadvantaged families. Barriers that might have kept teachers from seeing students' strengths were also examined. Results indicate two statistically significant relationships between teacher race and perceptions of student behavior. This study has implications for supporting teachers' more effective identification of strengths in all children."

The goal of this qualitative study was to understand academic motivation from the students' perspective. Focus group discussions with 28 university honors freshman revealed that students most often attributed their interest and motivation in high school to their interactions with their teachers. These findings supported the theoretical foundations of the Achievement Orientation Model and demonstrated how effective teachers can influence all components of that model as they encourage students' growth and satisfaction (building self-efficacy), as they make the content meaningful and challenging for their students (creating task valuation), and as they shape students' perception of support in their environment through building positive relationships and being knowledgeable about the content (fostering a positive environmental perception). Teachers with extensive depth and breadth of content knowledge are better able to foster student motivation. These teachers have the background to be comfortable differentiating content, straying from the familiar textbook territory, and delving into a variety of instruction strategies, such as in-depth discussions, with their students."

Full-time ability grouping of gifted students has been criticized for potentially detrimental socioemotional effects. Therefore, in the present longitudinal study, we investigated whether or not social self-concepts and school-related attitudes and beliefs are affected by full-time ability grouping of the gifted. Students in regular classes and students in special classes for the gifted were paralleled for cognitive ability, sex, socioeconomic status, and school. By doing so, we studied 99 statistical twins (N = 198) from the beginning of fifth grade to the middle of sixth grade. Data were analyzed through repeated-measures multivariate analysis of covariance (within-subject factor: time; between-subject factors: class typegifted vs. regularand cognitive ability as covariate). Cognitive ability had hardly any effect on the variables under study. Attending a gifted class had initially positive effects on students' social self-concept of acceptance but no effects on social self-concept of assertiveness. Moreover, children in gifted classes exhibited more interest in school and reported better student-teacher relationships than their counterparts in regular classes."
164,2014.0,Combining Scores in Multiple-Criteria Assessment Systems: The Impact of Combination Rule,"Combining Scores in Multiple-Criteria Assessment Systems: The Impact of Combination Rule multiple criteria; identification; psychometrics; combining scores; measurement Best practice in gifted and talented identification procedures involves making decisions on the basis of multiple measures. However, very little research has investigated the impact of different methods of combining multiple measures. This article examines the consequences of the conjunctive (and), disjunctive/complementary (or), and compensatory (mean) models for combining scores from multiple assessments. It considers the impact of rule choice on the size of the student population, the ability heterogeneity of the identified students, and the psychometric performance of such systems. It also uses statistical simulation to examine the performance of the state of Georgia's mandated and complex multiple-criteria assessment system."

Curriculum-based measures (Monitoring Instructional Responsiveness: Reading and Monitoring Instructional Responsiveness: Math) were administered to 1,242 third-grade students within a Response to Intervention paradigm. When gifted status is tentatively defined as high performance (i.e., 84th percentile and higher) on a Monitoring Instructional Responsiveness reading probe, 5.48% of students exhibited deficits in (math) performance consistent with a significant discrepancy between reading and math (i.e., reading score - math score); 4.83% exhibited a discrepancy in reading (i.e., math score - reading). These values are based on observed scores using the following formula to define a discrepancy: 1.5(SD) x SEe. Only 2.1% exhibited a math discrepancy and 1.13% a reading discrepancy based on predicted scores, which takes regression to the mean into account. Using various cut score criteria, practitioners can select from less than 1% to about 10% for screening purposes. When using predicted (rather than observed) scores and more stringent cut score criteria, percentages decline, as expected. Recommendations for using this process for screening are provided, as are implications for best practice, particularly the impact of using more or less conservative criteria for screening twice exceptional students."
167,2013.0,Differences Between Children With Dyslexia Who Are and Are Not Gifted in Verbal Reasoning,"Differences Between Children With Dyslexia Who Are and Are Not Gifted in Verbal Reasoning twice-exceptional; reading; elementary; middle school New findings are presented for children in Grades 1 to 9 who qualified their families for a multigenerational family genetics study of dyslexia (impaired word decoding/spelling) who had either superior verbal reasoning (n = 33 at or above 1 2/3 standard deviation, superior or better range; 19% of these children) or average verbal reasoning (n = 31 below population mean but above -2/3 standard deviation, average range; 18% of these children). Evidence-based rationale and results supporting the tested hypotheses are provided: (a) twice exceptional students with superior verbal reasoning and dyslexia significantly outperformed those with average verbal reasoning and dyslexia on reading, spelling, morphological, and syntactic skills, (b) but not on verbal working memory behavioral markers of genetically based dyslexia related to impaired phonological and orthographic word-form storage and processing, naming orthographic symbols (phonological loop), writing orthographic symbols (orthographic loop), and supervisory attention (focus, switch, sustain, or monitor attention). Superior verbal reasoning may mask dyslexia if only very low achievement is used to identify this disorder of oral word reading and written spelling. Instruction for twice exceptional students who have dyslexia, but are also verbally gifted, should focus not only on oral word reading and written spelling but also on the impaired working memory components within intellectually engaging lesson sets. These findings for gifted students with dyslexia are situated within the broader context of the many kinds of twice exceptionalities related to specific learning disabilities that exist in school-age children and youth."
168,2013.0,Creativity and Working Memory in Gifted Students With and Without Characteristics of Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder: Lifting the Mask,"Creativity and Working Memory in Gifted Students With and Without Characteristics of Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder: Lifting the Mask creativity; twice-exceptional; special populations; underserved gifted There have been some behavioral indicators and some types of task performance that suggest greater creativity in students with attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD). This evidence would appear counterintuitive given that lower working memory (i.e., holding information in mind for novel recombinations) has often been documented in students with ADHD. Thus, the purpose of this study was to assess working memory and creativity in two groups of gifted students (i.e., with characteristics of ADHD, n = 17, and without ADHD characteristics, n = 20), who were equivalent in fluid intelligence. Significant differences were found indicating that gifted students with ADHD characteristics had not only poorer working memory but also significantly greater creativity than those gifted students without these characteristics. These results were discussed in terms of creative potential, which could serve as an identifier and as a pathway to instruction."
169,2013.0,Twice-Exceptional Learners' Perspectives on Effective Learning Strategies,"Twice-Exceptional Learners' Perspectives on Effective Learning Strategies twice-exceptional learner; learning strategies; school experiences; qualitative; survey This mixed-methods study investigates the perspectives of twice-exceptional students on learning strategies that have been recommended for them in the literature. Have the strategies recommended in the literature been implemented? Do students perceive the strategies to be beneficial in helping them learn? Participants represented a broad range of coexisting exceptionalities and ranged in age from 10 to 23 years. While mainly qualitative, this study was informed by a survey adapted from the Possibilities for Learning survey. Qualitative in-depth interviews provided rich descriptions of which learning strategies were facilitators and barriers. Findings indicated that participants perceived that their overall school experiences failed to assist them in learning to their potential, although they were able to use their strengths to circumvent their weaknesses. Implications for teachers included allowing twice-exceptional learners more ownership over their learning and more choice and flexibility in topic, method of learning, assessment, pace, and implementation of group collaboration."
170,2013.0,The Influence of Primary Caregivers in Fostering Success in Twice-Exceptional Children,"The Influence of Primary Caregivers in Fostering Success in Twice-Exceptional Children twice-exceptional children; academic success; parents Using grounded theory, this study investigated primary caregivers' perceptions of the role they play in influencing the academic success of students formally identified as twice-exceptional. Data from interviews were coded and analyzed for themes. Results indicated that primary caregivers (mothers) perceived that they played a major role in the academic success of their twice-exceptional children, first by recognizing their children's gifts as well as disabilities and then by assuming responsibility for the development of their children's potential. They sought professional evaluations, provided or secured educational supports, shaped their children's healthy perceptions of their disabilities, and taught them how to advocate for themselves while simultaneously maintaining high expectations for their children, despite their disabilities. Implications of the findings are discussed, and areas for future research are outlined."
171,2013.0,Twice-Exceptional Learners: Who Needs to Know What?,"Twice-Exceptional Learners: Who Needs to Know What? multivariate analyses; quantitative methodologies; assessment; twice-exceptional; special populations; underserved gifted Twice-exceptionality is gaining increasing recognition in the gifted education literature but little is understood about the knowledge and awareness of this concept within the educational and psychological community, or about professionals' experience working with this population of learners. Three-hundred and seventeen individuals completed an online Twice-Exceptional Needs Assessment, which consisted of 14 questions assessing issues pertaining to twice-exceptionality knowledge and experience, as well as knowledge of policies relevant to both gifted and special education. Results indicated that educators were more familiar with standards within their specific area of expertise (e.g., gifted or special education) and that fewer professionals were familiar with the use of Response to Intervention with twice-exceptional children. Gifted education professionals had significantly more knowledge and experience with twice-exceptionality than did professionals in other domains. We conclude with implications for educators and recommendations for expanding professional understanding of twice-exceptionality outside the field of gifted education to meet twice-exceptional students' multifaceted needs."
172,2013.0,Characteristics Leading Teachers to Nominate Secondary Students as Gifted in Spain,"Characteristics Leading Teachers to Nominate Secondary Students as Gifted in Spain teacher; nomination; gifted; secondary education; Spain What are the characteristics leading teachers to nominate gifted students in Spain? To answer this question, several demographic (i.e., gender, grade) and psychological (i.e., multiple intelligences, emotional intelligence, intellectual aptitude, and divergent thinking) characteristics of 563 secondary students nominated as gifted by their teachers were analyzed. Results showed a general gifted profile of the nominated students defined by higher scores in their naturalist and social intelligences, stress management, and verbal, mechanical, and spatial reasoning. Additional analysis indicated that students' gender and grade also influenced teachers' nominations of gifted students. Based on the associations among the demographic and psychological characteristics included in this study, nominated students could be classified in five specific gifted profiles, namely, moderately gifted students, social-emotionally gifted students, artistically gifted students, intellectually gifted students, and generally gifted students. Discussion of the limitations of the study, directions for future research, and educational implications of the study are provided."

A Primer on Understanding Logistic Regression quantitative methodologies; policy; policy analysis; assessment The purpose of this Methodological Brief is to present a brief primer on logistic regression, a commonly used technique when modeling dichotomous outcomes. Using data from the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88), logistic regression techniques were used to investigate student-level variables in eighth grade (i.e., enrolled in a gifted class, gender, and socioeconomic status) that were associated with taking an Advanced Placement course in the 10th grade. Through the use of the NELS:88 data, the authors provide an example of how to interpret both categorical and continuous independent variables and illustrate how model fit can be assessed."

We first define the term paradigm, and then delineate three paradigms in the historical context. We then compare and contrast the three paradigms to elucidate their continuities and discontinuities. Finally, we discuss the importance of articulating the paradigmatic nature of approaches for educational and research purposes. The ultimate purpose of articulating the distinct approaches is to seek a common research agenda with clarity, rigor, and relevance."
175,2013.0,The Impact of Advanced Geometry and Measurement Curriculum Units on the Mathematics Achievement of First-Grade Students,"The Impact of Advanced Geometry and Measurement Curriculum Units on the Mathematics Achievement of First-Grade Students mathematics; primary; advanced; curriculum The goal of Project M2 was to develop and field-test challenging geometry and measurement units for K-2 students. The units were developed using recommendations from gifted, mathematics, and early childhood education. This article reports on achievement results for students in Grade 1 at 12 diverse sites in four states using the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills (ITBS) mathematics concepts subtest and an open-response assessment. Using HLM, as expected there were no statistical differences between the experimental (n = 186) and comparison (n = 174) groups on the ITBS (91% of the items focused on number). Statistically significant differences (p < .001) favoring the experimental group were found on the open-response assessment with a large effect size (d = 1.88). Thus the experimental group exhibited a deeper understanding of geometry and measurement concepts on the open-response assessment while performing as well on a traditional measure that covered all Grade 1 mathematics."
176,2013.0,Additional Validity Evidence and Across-Group Equivalency of the HOPE Teacher Rating Scale,"Additional Validity Evidence and Across-Group Equivalency of the HOPE Teacher Rating Scale factor analysis; identification; assessment; special populations/underserved gifted; low income The HOPE Scale was developed to identify academic and social components of giftedness and talent in elementary-aged students with particular attention to students from low-income and/or culturally diverse families. Based on previous findings, additional research was conducted on revisions made to the HOPE Scale. Items were added, and 71 teachers completed the HOPE Scale on 1,700 diverse students. The HOPE Scale was evaluated for differential item and test functioning with regard to gender, ethnic/racial, and income groups. Differential item functioning was not found with ethnic/racial or income group membership, but it existed for gender. HOPE Scale scores were also compared with achievement test scores to contribute criterion-related validity information. Results indicate that HOPE Scale scores account for approximately 52% to 58% of achievement test scores."
177,2013.0,"Minority Performance on the Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test, Second Edition, Versus the Cognitive Abilities Test, Form 6: One Gifted Program's Experience","Minority Performance on the Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test, Second Edition, Versus the Cognitive Abilities Test, Form 6: One Gifted Program's Experience NNAT2; CogAT6; WISC-IV; gifted; talent; minority; underrepresentation The Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test, Second Edition (NNAT2), is used widely to screen students for possible inclusion in talent development programs. The NNAT2 claims to provide a more culturally neutral evaluation of general ability than tests such as Form 6 of the Cognitive Abilities Test (CogAT6), which has Verbal and Quantitative batteries in addition to a Nonverbal battery. This study compared the performance of 5,833 second graders who took the CogAT6 and 4,038 kindergartners, first graders, and second graders who took the NNAT2 between 2005 and 2011 as part of a grade-wide screening for a gifted program. Comparison between minorities and Whites on the CogAT6 and the NNAT2 found slightly larger gaps on the CogAT6 Composite for Hispanics and English-Language Learners (ELL) but the same gap for Black students. Considered alone, the Nonverbal battery of CogAT6 produced smaller gaps than the NNAT2 for Blacks, Hispanics, Asians, and ELL students. Fisher's exact tests showed no significant differences between the CogAT6 Composite and the NNAT2 in subgroup identification rates at hypothetical cuts for gifted identification (top 20%, 10%, or 5%), except for Asian and ELL students. The CogAT6 Nonverbal score appeared to identify as many or more high-ability students from underrepresented groups as the NNAT2. Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Fourth Edition, follow-up on the top 5% showed greater predictive validity for the CogAT6 Composite. These results suggest that gifted programs should not assume that using a figural screening test such as the NNAT2, without other adjustments to selection protocol, will address minority underrepresentation."

However, the design has not been used widely in gifted education. In this article, an overview of the main features of single-subject design is presented, and its potential for application in gifted education is discussed. The article concludes with a report of a preliminary single-subject study, conducted with a young gifted child, in which the effects of higher order questioning are investigated."
179,2013.0,Homeschooling the Gifted: A Parent's Perspective,"Homeschooling the Gifted: A Parent's Perspective homeschooling; gifted; talented; parents; grounded theory Homeschooling has witnessed a dramatic growth over the past decade. Included in this population are gifted and talented students, yet despite this growth there has been no appreciable increase in the research literature. To better understand the gifted homeschooling family, researchers interviewed 13 parents of homeschooled children their parents identified as being gifted. Four major themes emerged from the data: (a) parents know best, (b) isolation, (c) challenges, and (d) family roles. Findings reveal that these parents decided to homeschool only after numerous attempts to work in collaboration with the public school and that the mothers bore the primary burden of responsibility for homeschooling in these families. Though the move to homeschooling alleviated many of the issues experienced in public school, it brought a different set of challenges to these families. This exploratory study establishes a better understanding of why parents of gifted children ultimately decide to homeschool."
180,2013.0,"High-Ability Students' Participation in Specialized Instructional Delivery Models: Variations by Aptitude, Grade, Gender, and Content Area","High-Ability Students' Participation in Specialized Instructional Delivery Models: Variations by Aptitude, Grade, Gender, and Content Area high-ability; science; math; language arts; gender Established in the early 1970s, the talent search model has garnered strong theoretical and programming support for addressing the academic needs of highly able students. The two main components of the talent search model are discovery (identification) and development (programming) of academic talent. Discovery of academically talented elementary and middle school students occurs via the process of above-level testing, usually offered through university-based centers. The essence of talent search program intervention is acceleration, which has robust research support as the most effective intervention for high-ability students. Whereas talent search identification and programming are university based, talent search participants receive nearly all of their instruction in K-12 settings, where academic acceleration is less likely to be implemented. In this investigation, a large sample of talent search participants (n = 5,844) were asked questions designed to measure the various ways in which the students study mathematics, science, and language arts (writing and reading) in the K-12 setting. More than two thirds of the study sample reported that they were taught in the regular classroom, learning the same material, at the same level and pace as nongifted peers. The type of curriculum differentiation or program delivery model (e.g., small-group instruction) reported by the students varied according to subject area, with the greatest percentage of reports of differentiated delivery in mathematics. Main effects were found for gender, grade, and ability. Implications for school-based accelerative interventions are presented."

Results revealed a range in reading comprehension across all schools of 9.2 grade levels in Grade 3, 11.3 in Grade 4, and 11.6 in Grade 5. A similar wide range of oral reading fluency scores was found across all elementary schools, as students scored from below the 10th percentile to above the 90th percentile. These results demonstrate the wide range of reading achievement in diverse populations of students, including gifted students, and the need for teachers to differentiate both reading content and instruction to enable all students to make continuous progress in reading."
182,2013.0,"Gifted Students' Perceptions of Parenting Styles: Associations With Cognitive Ability, Sex, Race, and Age","Gifted Students' Perceptions of Parenting Styles: Associations With Cognitive Ability, Sex, Race, and Age social and/or emotional development and adjustment; secondary age/developmental stage; factor analysis; qualitative methodologies Children whose parents are warm and responsive yet also set limits and have reasonable expectations for their children tend to have better outcomes than their peers whose parents show less warmth and responsiveness, have low expectations, or both. Parenting behavior is related to family race and children's sex, age, and cognitive ability. However, there is no work that examines how children's cognitive abilities are related to their perceptions of their mothers' and fathers' parenting styles and the extent to which these relationships are moderated by race, sex, and age in a sample of gifted students. Participants (N = 332, ages 9-17 years) attended a summer residential program for gifted students and completed the Parental Authority Questionnaire and the verbal battery of the Cognitive Abilities Test. Three main findings emerged. First, factor analyses provided support for the use of the Parent Authority Questionnaire with gifted populations. Second, findings from regression analyses as well as examinations of mean differences by cognitive ability level were consistent with earlier studies suggesting that more cognitively able students were likely to perceive their parents as employing a flexible (i.e., authoritative) parenting style. Finally, consonant with earlier studies with nonidentified populations, age, sex, and race were associated with parenting styles as reported by this group of identified gifted students. Results provide further support for the notion that authoritative parenting promotes positive outcomes for children, particularly those who have been identified as gifted."
183,2013.0,An Investigation of Play: From the Voices of Fifth- and Sixth-Grade Talented and Gifted Students,"An Investigation of Play: From the Voices of Fifth- and Sixth-Grade Talented and Gifted Students play; elementary talented and gifted; developmental domains; focus groups; online survey The purpose of this study was to explore the concept of play through the eyes of talented and gifted (TAG) fifth- and sixth-grade students. Three focus groups consisting of fifth- and sixth-grade TAG students were conducted in one urban, one suburban, and one rural school district in the Midwest. Students were asked to describe the value of play in the cognitive, physical, and social domains. Additional open-ended questions were asked about the importance of play and its relevance to their lives. From these results, an online survey was created. Data from an additional 162 fifth- and sixth-grade TAG respondents substantiated that play is a significant activity for learning and socializing in the general classroom, gifted programs, and outside their classrooms. Despite its importance, students experienced structural barriers for time to play. Putting the Research to Use Results of this study hold implications for teachers to acknowledge the value of play as a tool for learning. Children see play as a renewal activity. They see play as motivating and as a way to increase attention, retention, and focus in learning. Children emphasized that play develops teamwork and problem-solving skills. Play enhances meaningful activities in the talented and gifted program as well as the general classroom. Results of this study suggest that parents should acknowledge their children's need for play in all three domains (cognitive, physical, and social) and allow time for self-directed play after school with limits on scheduled activities."
184,2013.0,The STEM Pathway for Women: What Has Changed?,"The STEM Pathway for Women: What Has Changed? science; curriculum; college or adult; age/developmental stage; gifted females; special populations/underserved gifted In previous decades, researchers have identified a gender gap in the careers and academic achievement of men and women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Recently, it has been suggested that some of these gender gaps no longer exist; however, the picture is more nuanced, for women are represented well in some STEM fields (such as biology) and not in others (such as computer science). The current research employed survey methodology to explore the perceptions of 360 finalists and semifinalists of the prestigious Science Talent Search. Two cohorts of participants who were either in their late 30s (Cohort 2) or late 20s (Cohort 1) were contacted to investigate factors that influenced them to select or not select STEM college majors and occupations. Comparisons between men and women revealed that women recalled having lower self-efficacy in STEM in college than men, and fewer women selected STEM majors as undergraduates. Interest was cited as a major influence for occupational selection for both men and women. Proportionally, more women than men entered fields such as biology and fewer women entered fields such as engineering and physics/astronomy. A greater proportion of older women mentioned leaving STEM because of a lack of flexible hours and needing to attend to family responsibilities. Implications for education and future research are discussed."

The authors argue that society must strive to promote these opportunities, but that individuals with talent also have some responsibility for their own growth and development. Furthermore, the research knowledge base indicates that psychosocial variables are determining influences in the successful development of talent. Finally, preparing young people for outstanding achievement or eminence ought to be the chief goal of gifted education."

In this examination of their ideas, consideration is given to the literature in vocational psychology/career development, the emerging findings on the occupational/career decisions of gifted adolescents, and the existing research in gifted education. The new model represents a timely platform and impetus for a constructive discussion and debate on rethinking and advancing the field of gifted education."

The expansive scope of their synthesis is so impressive that it could serve as a crash course introduction to gifted education. In our commentary, we focus specifically on the perspective of education service delivery. From this perspective, we review their guiding principles, chief goal, and provide some follow-up questions for further clarification as well as an implementation option also based on talent development."

Examples of large-scale and longitudinal research studies from previous decades guided by the talent development approach are provided as illustrations. The implications of focusing on domain-specific talents in academics, the arts and sport, their individual patterns of development, and the use of eminence as a goal for programs and services in gifted education are discussed. The importance of linking theoretical debates and research with the realities of policies, resource allocation, and advocacy is emphasized."

The authors argue that the incoherence is an inevitable consequence of the fundamental incompatibility of theoretical and definitional features desired by psychologists and educators. Our field could best progress by splitting into the two related but distinct disciplines of high-ability psychology and advanced academics. Furthermore, the prospective adoption of Subotnik et al.'s eminence framework as an organizational principle for either advanced academics or high-ability psychology is criticized."
193,2012.0,Eminence-Focused Gifted Education: Concerns About Forward Movement Void of an Equity Vision,"Eminence-Focused Gifted Education: Concerns About Forward Movement Void of an Equity Vision equity; definition and/or conception of giftedness/talent; gifted Black students; gifted Hispanic students; special populations/underserved gift; low income students; assessment; identification; majority-minority public schools This article is based on Grantham's commentary on an eminence-focused gifted education model developed by Subotnik, Olszewski-Kubilius, and Worrell. Grantham primarily reviews the model from an equity perspective, taking into account the changing demographics in the nation's public schools. Specifically, Grantham asserts that education leaders want and need forward-thinking models that address race and class issues because public school populations are increasingly browner and poorer, unlike many gifted program enrollments that tend to represent students from White and middle-class backgrounds. Underrepresentation in gifted programs among minorities (particularly Blacks and Hispanics) and low-income students plagues our field and turns off many public school advocates to gifted education. Education leaders may embrace new models when they squarely address the reality that circa 2020, public schools will be majority minority. Researchers stand a better chance of gaining traction to move the field forward when their model shows promise for involving greater numbers of students representing our pluralistic society. To rethink giftedness and gifted education, Subotnik, Olszewski-Kubilius, and Worrell rely on works from psychology; however, important past and present perspectives from psychologists who have researched underrepresented groups and equity issues are excluded. Education leaders may recognize this omission and view the eminence-focused approach (and perhaps its underlying paradigm) as a less novel model and more of a perpetuation of the same status quo in gifted education. In sum, Grantham's commentary encourages scholars not to depart from a legacy of addressing excellence and equity through new models that move the field forward."

Using semistructured interviews, this study explores the perceptions of parents, teachers, and guidance counselors regarding participation of twice-exceptional students in Advanced Placement (AP) and for-college-credit classes. The supports and barriers for students with disabilities participating in AP and for-college-credit classes were identified. Additionally, participants included six college students who had taken AP and/or for-college-credit classes while still in high school. The results of this study indicated that school culture and early placement decisions affect enrollment in AP and for-college-credit classes for the twice-exceptional student. Inconsistencies between students' goals and transition planning and inconsistent implementation of test and environmental accommodations were documented."

Results indicate that the most commonly used statistical methods are means (85.9% of articles), standard deviations (77.8%), Pearson's r (47.8%), chi(2) (32.2%), ANOVA (30.7%), t tests (30.0%), and MANOVA (23.0%). Approximately half (53.3%) of the articles included reliability reports for the data at hand; Cronbach's alpha was the most commonly reported measure of reliability (41.5%). Some discussions of best statistical practice and implications for the field of gifted education are included."
199,2012.0,"The Effects of Peer Coaching on the Evaluation Knowledge, Skills, and Concerns of Gifted Program Administrators","The Effects of Peer Coaching on the Evaluation Knowledge, Skills, and Concerns of Gifted Program Administrators evaluation; identification; professional development; programming/service delivery models; special populations/underserved gifted To increase knowledge and skills in program evaluation, a peer-coaching intervention provided one-on-one professional development to gifted program administrators. This randomized field study examined the effects of peer coaching on evaluation knowledge and skills and on administrators' concerns about implementing more rigorous program evaluations. In addition, the peer-coaching intervention focused on increased access to program services for culturally diverse and low-income gifted learners. Results revealed a statistically significant increase in gifted administrators' knowledge of and skills in program evaluation attributed to the peer-coaching intervention. Peer-coached program administrators were less distracted and more focused on implementing program evaluation and reported decreased concerns about implementing them. Peer coaching did not increase placements for culturally diverse and low-income learners in program services; however, peer coaching positively affected referral rate for traditionally underrepresented groups."
200,2012.0,Reexamining the Role of Gifted Education and Talent Development for the 21st Century: A Four-Part Theoretical Approach,"Reexamining the Role of Gifted Education and Talent Development for the 21st Century: A Four-Part Theoretical Approach gifted education; Enrichment Triad Model; Operation Houndstooth; talent development; Three Ring Conception of Giftedness Why and how should a society devote special resources to the development of giftedness in young people for the twenty-first century? If we agree that the goals of gifted education and talent development are to maximize young people's opportunities for self-fulfillment and increase society's reservoir of creative problem solvers and producers of knowledge, then it would seem wise that programming and services enhance students' capacity for creative productivity, not just content acquisition. This general theory for the development of human potential is discussed through an exploration of four research-based subtheories: the Three-Ring Conception of Giftedness, the Enrichment Triad Model, Operation Houndstooth, and Executive Functions. In this article, a reexamination of current gifted and talented programming is intended to generate future research, extend dialogue among scholars, and inspire continued support for programming based on theory and related research."
201,2012.0,How Are Schools in England Addressing the Needs of Mathematically Gifted Children in Primary Classrooms? A Review of Practice,"How Are Schools in England Addressing the Needs of Mathematically Gifted Children in Primary Classrooms? A Review of Practice giftedness; mathematics; provision; teaching; ability grouping There is a paucity of research investigating aspects of provision for gifted children within primary schools, particularly in mathematics. This study aimed to address this topic by illuminating issues arising from classroom practice and the experience of both teachers and children. Based on in-depth case studies in four primary schools in which different methods of provision were being implemented, this study found that although there is an interest in addressing the needs of mathematically gifted children and schools have taken measures in pragmatic terms to cater to them, the needs of these children are not always addressed in classrooms. Evidence from classroom practice showed that the effectiveness of any method depends on teachers' expertise and self-confidence, the level of focused attention given to gifted children, the size of the class, and the nature of the work set. Additionally, this study identified issues relating to organizational strategies of classroom provision which need consideration and further research."

Inclusion criteria were a diagnosis of autism (high functioning) or Asperger syndrome and at least one ability and/or achievement index standard score of 120 or above. Results indicated that despite the restricted range of cognitive abilities, students diagnosed with Asperger syndrome had significantly higher Verbal Comprehension Index scores than did students diagnosed with autism. However, students with autism had significantly higher scores on tests of math fluency and written expression than did students with Asperger syndrome. Implications for assessment, diagnosis, and intervention are discussed."

However, RDD does not require the random assignment of individuals to treatment and control groups, making it very attractive for applied researchers in educational settings. This Brief introduces the method, discusses applications and limitations, and illustrates an idealized example as well as some potential pitfalls and their relevance to the context of gifted education research."
204,2012.0,Academically Gifted Students' Perceived Interpersonal Competence and Peer Relationships,"Academically Gifted Students' Perceived Interpersonal Competence and Peer Relationships multivariate analyses; peer relationships; secondary; social and/or emotional development and adjustment Perceptions of the interpersonal competence and peer relationships of 1,526 gifted adolescents who had previously participated in academic gifted programs at the Center for Talent Development were examined, using an online survey. Major findings included that the gifted students had generally positive perceptions of their abilities to initiate, form, and maintain relationships with other people, including same-age nongifted peers, and demonstrated levels of interpersonal ability and peer relationships, comparable to that of grade equivalent students in the norming group. The students did not perceive their giftedness as a negative factor affecting their peer relationships but rated their academic self-concept more positively than their social self-concept. Differences were found by gender and experience with subject acceleration in school, favoring female students over male students and favoring students who were accelerated in a subject in school over students who were not. The results also suggested that gifted students whose academic strength was in the verbal area over other areas were more likely to face difficulties with peer relationships."
205,2012.0,The Forced Choice Dilemma: A Model Incorporating Idiocentric/Allocentric Cultural Orientation,"The Forced Choice Dilemma: A Model Incorporating Idiocentric/Allocentric Cultural Orientation gifted education; forced choice dilemma; cultural orientation; idiocentrism; allocentrism; Australia This study developed and tested a new model of the forced choice dilemma (i.e., the belief held by some intellectually gifted students that they must choose between academic achievement and peer acceptance) that incorporates individual-level cultural orientation variables (i.e., vertical allocentrism and vertical idiocentrism). A survey that had previously been administered to a sample of intellectually gifted Australian adolescents was modified and then administered to a new sample of 450 intellectually gifted Australian students enrolled in Grades 7 through 12. The data were analyzed using structural equation modeling procedures. The major findings of the study were that: (a) motivation for academic success and need for peer acceptance generally predict the experience of the forced choice dilemma, and (b) vertical allocentric and vertical idiocentric orientations strongly predict motivation for academic success. The findings of the study provide insights that may assist educators, psychologists, counselors, and family members to better understand, and guide, intellectually gifted students affected by the forced choice dilemma. Putting the Research to Use Educators, psychologists, counselors, and families may be able to use the model developed and confirmed in this study to better understand how some intellectually gifted students experience the dilemma arising from a perceived conflict between academic achievement and peer acceptance. The model provides insights on how specific cultural orientations of students may play a part in how the dilemma is experienced. It appears that intellectually gifted students who value human inequality and interdependence are more able to resolve the dilemma; hence, attention in this realm should be focused on those students who place greater importance on human equality and/or independence, for whom the dilemma may be a more difficult issue."
206,2012.0,Examining the Effects of Gifted Programming in Mathematics and Reading Using the ECLS-K,"Examining the Effects of Gifted Programming in Mathematics and Reading Using the ECLS-K gifted education; elementary schools; achievement; attitude; hierarchical linear modeling; propensity score analysis This study examined the average effects of schools' third through fifth grade gifted programming policy in mathematics and reading on overall school achievement, on gifted students' achievement and academic attitudes and on nongifted students' achievement and academic attitudes. Data and results represent a broad, national look at school personnel-reported programming without distinction as to type, length, or degree of programming. No detrimental effects were found at the overall school level or for nongifted students. However, the results also indicated that, on average, the diverse programs reported in the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1988-1989 (ECLS-K) database had no effect on gifted students' achievement or academic attitudes. Considered in light of prior research indicating benefits of specific programs and existing inconsistent policies and programs, this suggests the need for future research to determine effective program characteristics and suggests that policy makers, educators, and parents actively must seek research-based practices to use with gifted children."

The 8-year-long qualitative study involved extensive interviews with the two gifted girls and their parents to determine factors that led to their choice of a nonmathematical area of specialization in spite of early identification and support of their mathematical talent. Using tenets of qualitative inquiry to code the longitudinal data, the authors identified three main factors that contributed to these career choices, which are presented in the form of narratives. One of the startling findings of this study, contrary to the literature in gifted education research, is that the two girls' early experiences with gifted education kept them from choosing careers related to mathematics. The article also narrates the enculturation of mathematically gifted girls in Korea that leads to nonmathematical career aspirations."
211,2011.0,Being Gifted in Hong Kong: An Examination of the Region's Policy for Gifted Education,"Being Gifted in Hong Kong: An Examination of the Region's Policy for Gifted Education analysis; gifted education; Hong Kong; policy In Hong Kong, a policy for the education of its gifted students has existed in its current form since 2000. However, the gifted education policy is yet to be evaluated, despite growing calls internationally and locally for increased accountability of public policy, including policies relating to gifted education. Using VanTassel-Baska's five-component model of a high-quality gifted education policy as their conceptual framework, the authors analyze and evaluate the gifted education policy in Hong Kong by first collecting source materials related to the gifted education policy and conducting interviews with three key policy makers. A total of 75 documents and the interview data were subjected to content analysis and the findings indicate that the gifted education policy in Hong Kong has an additional component, which the authors term aims and objectives. Although the aims and objectives differ across the eight groups of beneficiaries, they are not explicitly stated. In addition, the policy neither reflects current research in giftedness nor is it mandated, highlighting possible areas that limit its effectiveness. It is concluded that a thorough update of the policy is warranted if it is to meet its stated aims and objectives."
212,2011.0,Cognitive and Motivational Characteristics of Elementary Teachers in General Education Classrooms and in Gifted Programs,"Cognitive and Motivational Characteristics of Elementary Teachers in General Education Classrooms and in Gifted Programs cognitive characteristics; motivational characteristics; teachers; general education classrooms; gifted programs Whether teachers in general education classrooms and in gifted programs differ in their cognitive and motivational characteristics was examined in 182 elementary school teachers. The teacher characteristics examined were epistemological beliefs (beliefs about the nature of knowledge and beliefs about the nature of learning), metacognition (planning, monitoring, and strategy selection), and motivation (self-efficacy, intrinsic motivation, and goal orientation). Teachers in gifted programs reported more sophisticated epistemological beliefs, higher learning-goal orientation, and lower performance-goal orientation than did teachers in general education classrooms. However, perceived use of metacognitive strategies, self-efficacy, and intrinsic motivation were not different between the two groups. Teachers in general reported epistemological sophistication more in the nature of learning than in the nature of knowledge, that they use cognitive strategies more so than planning and monitoring of their activities, and that they are more learning-goal oriented than performance-goal oriented. It is suggested that more courses and trainings are needed for preservice and in-service teachers so they have opportunities to learn and self-reflect on their own characteristics."
213,2011.0,Grouping for Achievement Gains: For Whom Does Achievement Grouping Increase Kindergarten Reading Growth?,"Grouping for Achievement Gains: For Whom Does Achievement Grouping Increase Kindergarten Reading Growth? achievement grouping; reading achievement; ECLS-K; kindergarten With ever-present budget cuts, teachers often use within-class achievement grouping to meet the needs of students of all ability levels but particularly high-ability students. Using a national database, this study examined the relationship between achievement grouping and the size of achievement groups on kindergarten reading growth. Additionally, it examined whether those relationships differed for kindergarteners in a gifted program. Findings suggest that achievement grouping is related to higher reading achievement, particularly when the average group size is small. Furthermore, although students provided gifted programming at the early grade of kindergarten generally experienced less kindergarten reading growth than their peers, this study suggests the use of achievement grouping provided them the opportunity and instruction to improve their reading achievement during the kindergarten year."

The preferences of 416 students identified as gifted (grades 3-8) for features of differentiated curriculum recommended for gifted students were compared with those of 230 students not identified as gifted. While thinking of their favorite school subject, they responded to the 110 items on the Possibilities for Learning survey. Most and least popular items are reported in nine thematic categories (pace, collaborative learning, choice, curriculum content, evaluation, open-ended activities, expert knowledge, teacher/student relationship, and sharing learning). Self-pacing, choice of topic, and choice of workmates were most popular with students in both groups. Compared with nonidentified students, more of the students identified as gifted wanted to learn about complex, extracurricular topics and authentic, sophisticated knowledge and interconnections among ideas; to work with others some of the time; and to choose the format of the products of their learning. More students identified as gifted also disliked waiting for the rest of the class and asking for help. Overall, the groups' preferences differed in degree rather than kind, and reflected cognitive abilities frequently cited as distinguishing characteristics of learners with high ability."

Despite the versatility and easy interpretability of multiple regression, it has some shortcomings in the detection of suppressor variables and for somewhat arbitrarily assigning values to the structure coefficients of correlated independent variables. Commonality analysis-heretofore rarely used in gifted education research-is a statistical method that partitions the explained variance of a dependent variable into nonoverlapping parts according to the independent variable(s) that are related to each portion. This Methodological Brief includes an example of commonality analysis and equations for researchers who wish to conduct their own analyses; an Excel spreadsheet that conducts the procedure automatically is available from the journal's supplemental archive or from the author."

Analysis of Likert-type responses and brief comments from the students offered guidance for curriculum development and delivery. Differences in a positive direction reflected institutionalization of the group program and support for continuation. However, findings also underscored the need to clarify the purpose of the program to students, select discussion topics carefully, consider gender when forming groups, provide adequate time for group meetings, and provide adequate training for group facilitators."

Metacognition was measured using student self-reports of metacognitive awareness, acquired at the start of a semester-long course on biology, and students' global (pre- and posttest) and local (item-by-item) confidence judgments to assess monitoring across four biology exams over the course of one semester. Gifted students outperformed typical students on both local and global postdictive measures of calibration. However, there were no statistically significant differences in global predictive judgments or calibration bias. Local, item-by-item calibration accuracy partially mediated the relation between giftedness and exam performance. Implications for both theory and practice are discussed."

Individual in-depth interviews were conducted with the respondents to discern whether they experience flow as they each engage in their respective art forms (visual arts, dance, music, and theater). Qualitative analysis of the interview transcripts reveals elements of the flow state (clear goals, intense concentration, enjoyment, loss of self-consciousness, transformation of time) highly evident among the talented teenagers. Environmental supports that enable expressions of artistic inclinations and identities within the Singapore context were likewise in conjunction with implications for arts-educators and artist-practitioners."

Also discussed in the literature are the unique social, emotional, and behavioral characteristics associated with giftedness. However, there is still an unclear picture concerning the implications of this work as related to the specific counseling needs of gifted students, and little empirical support is provided. This study seeks to build, through a developmental lens, a more comprehensive base from which to design counseling and teaching approaches with gifted students. Findings indicate that the ego levels of gifted students are slightly higher than those of typical adolescents. Empirical evidence of the level of development related to Dabrowski's theory of positive disintegration for gifted adolescents is provided, with the majority of respondents (70%) falling within Dabrowski's Level II-Unilevel Disintegration stage. Results also indicated that the gifted students studied are relatively well adjusted and that the behaviors exhibited by gifted adolescents are normally distributed. Study results are interpreted as indicating that although ego development and Dabrowski's theory of positive disintegration may share similarities, they are different constructs, and further investigation is needed to best use these theories in designing appropriate and effective counseling and teaching intervention strategies for working with gifted adolescents. Limitations of the study and suggestions for future research are presented."
224,2011.0,A Primer on Research Ethics in the Field of Gifted Education,"A Primer on Research Ethics in the Field of Gifted Education human subjects research; Institutional Review Boards Most organizations (e. g., institutions of higher education, K-12 school systems) that engage in research with human subjects have institutional review boards (IRBs; also known as research committees) responsible for the oversight of research activities to ensure the ethical treatment of participants. Professional societies such as American Educational Research Association (AERA) and the American Psychological Association (APA) have also developed ethical codes for research activities involving human subjects. Many journals, including GCQ, require that all research considered for publication is accompanied by documentation of review and approval by an IRB or other similar committee. The purpose of this Methodological Brief is to provide researchers, new and experienced, within the field of gifted education a brief introduction to the ethical principles that guide the decision making process of IRBs, to provide examples of what might be considered ethical code violations, and to offer suggestions for working through the review and approval process with IRB officials.(1)"

In this study, the peer relationships of nine mathematically gifted adolescent females living in Taiwan are explored using a qualitative multicase study. Data analysis revealed six compelling themes: a proclivity for aloneness, indifference to popularity, better rapport with gifted peers, preference for self-contained gifted classes, preference for gifted classes with a majority of boys, and more attachment to family than to friends. Inconsistencies with extant literature offer an opportunity to contemplate the socioemotional issues of mathematically gifted adolescent females from new angles. Putting the Research to Use The results of this study provide some insights into serving the needs of gifted girls. It is important for gifted girls to interact well with peers. However, they also need opportunities to learn to work and play alone, which are beneficial for their development of intrapersonal intelligence. Besides, schools should meet their need to meet and work with other gifted students with similar interests and values. When decisions are made about grouping options, the decisions should be based on the results of empirical studies and also on gifted girls' voice. In addition, some gifted girls may feel torn between their indignation at the gender inequality still existing in the current society and their greater willingness to work with their male peers. They should be assured that it is all right to have this kind of inner conflict and that inner conflict can provide impetus for growth."

Research indicates that teacher enthusiasm, feedback, and content knowledge are keys to student motivation, learning, and engagement. Research also reveals the importance of positive and supportive student/teacher relationships. In previous work concerning student attitudes toward school, a handful of teachers emerged, in the eyes of their students, as exemplary. Follow-up study provided insights concerning the characteristics, practices, and qualities of these teachers. What and how they teach, and the ways they relate to individual students distinguish these exemplary and talented teachers. This research reveals quantitative and qualitative findings that help to explain the student-identified exemplary teachers (n = 18) from two samples that included more than 400 teachers. Implications for practice based on findings from these exemplary teachers are highlighted."

Four main research topics emerged from the survey: creativity/creatively gifted, achievement/underachievement, identification, and talent development. Rich and broad conceptual spaces linking these four categories to their psychological underpinnings and educational implications have been explored by this body of research, though the conceptual spaces are still too loosely organized to be seen as paradigmatic. Several prominent trends are identified, including the emergent qualitative studies (accounting for a quarter of the total studies) and the dominance of descriptive (comparative and correlational) research. Although most psychosocial studies are conducted in the context of gifted education, there still seems to be a gap between theory and practice, between psychological understanding of gifted development and promoting such development through education. More systematic, sustainable programs of research and more coordination among researchers are warranted to move the field forward."

A total of 511 in-service teachers participated in the study, 334 of whom were from Beijing and 177 were from Hong Kong. The scale developed by D. W. Chan was used as the instrument to examine the competencies and characteristics of the teachers. The Beijing in-service teachers gave significantly higher self-ratings for their characteristics and competencies than the Hong Kong in-service teachers. Beijing in-service teachers who taught in schools for the gifted (supernormal schools) gave the highest ratings for all the variables. This study analyzed the reasons behind why teachers in each city would have such ratings on competencies and characteristics for themselves, and why Beijing teachers (especially those who taught in supernormal schools) would have significantly higher ratings than their Hong Kong counterparts."

(2010) assessment; identification; dual exceptionality Gifted students often fail to achieve at a superior level in one or more academic areas. In this reply to an article by Assouline, Nicpon, and Whiteman, the author reviews various explanations for this phenomenon, including motivation/interest, learning opportunities, and error in measuring students' ability-achievement discrepancies. The author also describes different methodologies for investigating whether learning disabilities are overidentified among gifted students and, more broadly, considers the appropriateness of a learning disability diagnosis in students with average achievement. The author concludes with thoughts on the proper interpretation of Assouline et al.'s results."

The three primary alternative explanations include measurement error, (lack of) motivation, and/or past experiences. In our reply, we offer extensive evidence that refutes these alternative explanations. The critique also offers an interpretation, which we determined to be inaccurate, of our data; therefore, we correct the misinterpretation. We conclude with a confirmation of our original findings: identification of gifted students with specific learning disabilities requires a comprehensive psycho-educational evaluation that includes an examination of the cognitive profile generated from individually-administered tests of ability and achievement. In combination with a psychosocial profile that addresses behavior, self-concept, interests, and motivation, educators have the necessary information to guide them in identifying and developing the unique talents of gifted children with SLD."

232,2011.0,Academic Giftedness and Alcohol Use in Early Adolescence,"Academic Giftedness and Alcohol Use in Early Adolescence social and/or emotional development and adjustment; middle school; univariate analyses Adolescence is a period of development particularly vulnerable to the effects of alcohol use, with recent studies underscoring alcohol's effects on adolescent brain development. Despite the alarming rates and consequences of adolescent alcohol use, gifted adolescents are often overlooked as being at risk for early alcohol use. Although gifted adolescents may possess protective factors that likely inhibit the use of alcohol, some gifted youth may be vulnerable to initiating alcohol use during adolescence as experimenting with alcohol may be one way gifted youth choose to compensate for the social price (whether real or perceived) of their academic talents. To address the dearth of research on alcohol use among gifted adolescents the current study (a) examined the extent to which gifted adolescents use alcohol relative to their nongifted peers and (b) examined the adjustment profile of gifted adolescents who had tried alcohol relative to nongifted adolescents who tried alcohol as well as gifted and nongifted abstainers. More than 300 students in seventh grade (42.5% gifted) participated in the present study. Results indicated gifted students have, in fact, tried alcohol at rates that do not differ from nongifted students. Although trying alcohol was generally associated with negative adjustment, giftedness served as a moderating factor such that gifted students who had tried alcohol were less at risk than their nongifted peers. However, evidence also suggests that gifted adolescents who tried alcohol may be a part of a peer context that promotes substance use, which may place these youth at risk for adjustment difficulties in the future. Putting the Research to Use This research demonstrates that a fruitful line of future research would focus on examining the potential mechanisms underlying alcohol use among gifted youth. Individual differences with regard to endorsing a high desirability of gaining social acceptance or fitting in with non-gifted peers or distancing oneself from a gifted image may explain why some gifted students use alcohol and others do not. Until the underlying reasons of alcohol use/experimentation among gifted adolescents are better understood and researched further, it is not clear whether current prevention and intervention programs are effective for this subgroup of adolescents."

In this article, a 20-year review of the empirical literature examining twiceexceptionality, specifically gifted students with learning disabilities, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or autism spectrum disorder, was conducted. Research strongly suggests that gifted students can have a coexisting disability and that comprehensive, individualized approaches toward diagnosis are necessary. Less is known about effective treatments and interventions that simultaneously highlight strengths and accommodate for areas of growth. Future research directions are offered that ideally will encourage scholars to discover more about effective diagnostic and intervention techniques for this very important group of gifted learners. df"

Ethnographic field methods were used to uncover the essences of the reading experience in the contexts of their daily lives. Data sources included the researcher's field notes, the girls' taped book discussions, parent interviews, and the girls' reading journals. Major findings were that the girls read and make meaning in and around three interconnected areas of intelligence and intensity: intellectual, imaginational, and emotional. As they read fiction, the girls engage in a process of determined growth in each of these domains of human awareness. The girls challenge themselves with difficult literature, critical and empathic thinking, and problem finding. As the girls read and make meaning, they are involved in constructing their lives' purpose. They are youthful self-actualizers."
235,2011.0,The Effects of Acceleration on High-Ability Learners: A Meta-Analysis,"The Effects of Acceleration on High-Ability Learners: A Meta-Analysis acceleration; meta-analysis; high-ability learners; academic achievement; social emotional development Current empirical research about the effects of acceleration on high-ability learners' academic achievement and social-emotional development were synthesized using meta-analytic techniques. A total of 38 primary studies conducted between 1984 and 2008 were included. The results were broken down by developmental level (P-12 and postsecondary) and comparison group (whether the accelerants were compared with same-age, older, or mixed-age peers). The findings are consistent with the conclusions from previous meta-analytic studies, suggesting that acceleration had a positive impact on high-ability learners' academic achievement (g = 0.180, 95% CI = -.072, .431, under a random-effects model). In addition, the social-emotional development effects appeared to be slightly positive (g = 0.076, 95% CI = -.025, .176, under a random-effects model), although not as strong as for academic achievement. No strong evidence regarding the moderators of the effects was found."

Results showed that for the sample of gifted students used in this study, regardless of age, males outperformed females on the math and science subtests with the most pronounced differences on the math subtests, whereas females outperformed males on the verbal subtests. All these differences between genders did not diminish over the 9-year period but were steady with small or negligible effect sizes. The ratios of males to females in specific score ranges on the off-level tests were also steady and consistent, favoring males at the highest end in math and science with the maximum ratio of 3:1 and females at the highest end in verbal areas with the maximum ratio of 2:1. Performance differences by ethnicity and annual household income levels were also found throughout the years."

This brief discusses the rationale of propensity score matching, the major implementation steps and considerations, and illustrates the procedures with a data example. Some limitations and implementation challenges are also discussed."
238,2010.0,Parental Influences on the Academic Motivation of Gifted Students: A Self-Determination Theory Perspective,"Parental Influences on the Academic Motivation of Gifted Students: A Self-Determination Theory Perspective self-determination theory; parenting; motivation; gifted children; United States The home environment that parents provide their gifted children can have a significant impact on academic motivation, yet limited research has focused on this topic. Self-determination theory, a comprehensive framework of motivation, was used in the current study to explore two research questions: (a) What attitudes do parents of gifted students have toward the academic motivation of their children? (b) What approaches do parents of gifted students use at home to develop academic motivation? Interviews with 30 parents of gifted children from across the United States revealed three higher order themes including Parents as Experts, Scaffolding, and Behavior Modification. From a self-determination theory perspective, results suggest that despite good intentions, the parents of this study were inconsistent in providing home environments that support their children's development of internalized forms of academic motivation."

These practices were identification, organization for instruction, content, instructional strategies, continuous improvement assessment, and ambassadorship. Sixty-one teachers received training in these practices and were evaluated on their implementation, with usable data from 37. Implementation ratings were correlated with measure of reading attitude and literary analysis. Several correlations were discovered that have implications for understanding teaching style and the influence of teacher practice on student outcomes."

Because of this, new means of identifying such children must be developed. This article presents the findings of exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses conducted on the HOPE Scale, a 13-item teacher-rating instrument designed to identify academic and social components of giftedness in elementary-aged students. Participants included 349 teachers who completed HOPE Scales on 5,995 ethnically and economically diverse students from three rural and two metropolitan school districts in the Midwest. Multigroup confirmatory factor analysis was also used to evaluate measurement invariance between income groups. Findings suggest a two-factor model represents good fit for the data while remaining loyal to the latent constructs of academic and social giftedness. Although showing some legitimate mean differences, invariance test results suggested equivalence of model form, factor loading, and factor variances across income groups."
242,2010.0,Modeling Outcomes With Floor or Ceiling Effects: An Introduction to the Tobit Model,"Modeling Outcomes With Floor or Ceiling Effects: An Introduction to the Tobit Model Tobit; ceiling effect; regression; quantitative methods; statistics In gifted education research, it is common for outcome variables to exhibit strong floor or ceiling effects due to insufficient range of measurement of many instruments when used with gifted populations. Common statistical methods (e. g., analysis of variance, linear regression) produce biased estimates when such effects are present. In practice, it is frequent for researchers to ignore ceiling effects and proceed with traditional analysis. However, the problems caused by ceiling effects are not without possible solutions. This Methodological Brief describes a variation of multiple regression, called the Tobit model, which is capable of correct inference when floor or ceiling effects are present. A brief simulation study illustrates the performance of the Tobit model with a dataset exhibiting a ceiling effect."

As part of a larger study investigating the effectiveness of local policies developed within the framework of state law, we used a qualitative approach to examine the 'minimum' and 'exemplary' criteria from the Student Identification portion of these NAGC Standards. Through this process we developed a 27-item checklist, which we then used to evaluate 43 locally developed plans for identifying diverse gifted learners from one large state in the southeastern United States. Based on this experience, we identify the strengths and weaknesses that we encountered in using the Standards for this purpose. We provide the checklist items we developed, and we offer specific suggestions for how the Gifted Program Standards in their currently ongoing revision process might be made more user-friendly for practitioners to apply toward effective evaluation of gifted program documents."

The survey gathered information on school counselors' perceptions of and experiences with acceleration as a program option for gifted students. Results indicate that, although school counselors' opinions are being solicited in decision making regarding acceleration, they do not possess training and accurate information regarding acceleration. Hence, training and professional development focusing on the research-based practices of acceleration are needed to ensure that school counselors give accurate advice and guidance concerning gifted students' education. Future research is needed to compare and contrast the effectiveness of accelerative decision making between school counselors who are trained and untrained in acceleration programmatic options."
245,2010.0,The Teacher Observation Form: Revisions and Updates,"The Teacher Observation Form: Revisions and Updates instrumentation; teacher observation; program evaluation; gifted education; teacher practices This article discusses the original development and subsequent updates and revisions made to the Teacher Observation Form (TOF). The TOF is a 12-item form to be used by evaluators in the observation of teachers of gifted and talented students. After nearly 25 years of use, the original TOF was revised based on input from content experts and modified to reflect current effective standards of practices in gifted education. The revised TOF was then used on 217 occasions over a 2-year period to evaluate teachers in university-based enrichment programs. Results indicated that alpha reliability estimates increased for 9 of the 12 TOF items and that the overall rater-level effect (intraclass correlation coefficient) was comparable with that of classroom-level effects in standardized test scores. Based on these findings the authors offer the TOF as a means to provide feedback to teachers as to the prevalence of gifted education pedagogical effective practices in their classrooms."
246,2010.0,The Efficacy of Academic Acceleration for Gifted Minority Students,"The Efficacy of Academic Acceleration for Gifted Minority Students academic acceleration; gifted minority students; Project EXCITE; peer pressure This study supported the use of acceleration for gifted minority students in math. The gifted minority students in this study viewed taking accelerated math courses as exciting and beneficial for preparation for high school and college and particularly liked the challenges they encountered while taking advanced classes. They enjoyed working ahead and having a leg up in school and were infused with a special feeling of being gifted and talented in taking accelerated math. Ethnicity was not a major factor for teachers' support for acceleration. The teachers believed that acceleration provides necessary challenges for students, makes them committed to schoolwork, and enhances their academic achievement. No negative peer pressure resulting from academic acceleration was found, though the teachers were more certain than the students about the existence of negative peer culture for gifted minority students."
247,2010.0,Preservice Teachers' Perceptions and Experiences in a Gifted Education Training Model,"Preservice Teachers' Perceptions and Experiences in a Gifted Education Training Model preservice; preservice training; gifted training; practicum With the prevalence of gifted students in general education classrooms, all teachers will be responsible for providing appropriate programming for them, resulting in a need for training in the education of the gifted to be introduced at the preservice level. In this study, the researchers investigated the effectiveness of a combined intervention strategy for preservice teachers, consisting of a course in the education of the gifted and an accompanying 9-week practicum, in increasing participants' understanding of the characteristics and needs of gifted students. Through semistructured interviews, participants' perceptions of the effects the interventions had on their understanding of gifted students' characteristics and needs were examined. The findings from the interviews were triangulated with classroom observations, lesson plans, and participant responses to the Survey of Practices with Students of Varying Needs. Participants perceived an increase in their understanding of the needs and characteristics of gifted students through participation in the interventions as well as increased confidence in their general teaching abilities. Implications of the study for teacher education and future research are discussed."
248,2010.0,Career Decision Making Among Gifted Students: The Mediation of Teachers,"Career Decision Making Among Gifted Students: The Mediation of Teachers gifted students; career orientations; teacher influences; school experiences; science education; mathematics education; humanities education There is international concern about falling enrollments in higher education, particularly the sciences, by gifted students. In this mixed methods study, the top-performing 200 students (approximately 2%) within a particular education jurisdiction at the beginning of their first year at university were surveyed, and 20 interviewed about their school experiences using a biographical interpretive design. This study focused on identifying those characteristics of teachers that supported students' interests. Participants identified seven characteristics of teachers that students identified as supportive of their potential career pathways. These included connecting pedagogical practices with student interests, being passionate about their subject matter, having good content knowledge, making learning experiences relevant, setting high expectations of students, being a good explainer of complex ideas, and being a good classroom manager. This study extends our knowledge of how teachers influence gifted students and has implications for both preservice and in-service teacher education and career counseling."
249,2010.0,A Progressive Pedagogy for Online Learning With High-Ability Secondary School Students: A Case Study,"A Progressive Pedagogy for Online Learning With High-Ability Secondary School Students: A Case Study online pedagogy; online technologies; international case study; high-ability students This article describes a case study of a group of ten 14-year-old students who engaged with an online extended-learning project as an extracurricular activity for about 6 months. The students were physically located in Australia, Malaysia, and the United Kingdom. The facilitation and online learning made use of a progressive pedagogy that moved from structured, whole group online participation to a more individual, open approach to learning. The study investigated students' motivation to participate in the online learning and explored the nature of the interactions in an online learning environment. The findings show that students interacted differently online, depending on the task at hand. Seven of the 10 students completed the final task of creating learning products. The implications of the study for online learning with high-ability school students are discussed."
250,2010.0,Dealing With Dependence (Part II): A Gentle Introduction to Hierarchical Linear Modeling,"Dealing With Dependence (Part II): A Gentle Introduction to Hierarchical Linear Modeling clustered data; hierarchical linear modeling; gifted education research In education, most naturally occurring data are clustered within contexts. Students are clustered within classrooms, classrooms are clustered within schools, and schools are clustered within districts. When people are clustered within naturally occurring organizational units such as schools, classrooms, or districts, the responses of people from the same cluster are likely to exhibit some degree of relatedness with each other. The use of hierarchical linear modeling allows researchers to adjust for and model this non-independence. Furthermore, it may be of great substantive interest to try to understand the degree to which people from the same cluster are similar to each other and then to try to identify variables that help us to understand differences both within and across clusters. In HLM, we endeavor to understand and explain between-and within-cluster variability of an outcome variable of interest. We can also use predictors at both the individual level (level 1), and the contextual level (level 2) to explain the variance in the dependent variable. This article presents a simple example using a real data set and walk through the interpretation of a simple hierarchical linear model to illustrate the utility of the technique."

Although research has examined the effects of ethnicity and gender on NNAT performance, little published research has examined the relationship between socioeconomic status (SES) and NNAT performance. Correlations and multiple regression were used to examine the relationships between ethnicity, SES, and NNAT performance in a large kindergarten sample. The results suggest a significant relationship between ethnicity, SES, and NNAT performance. Even after adjusting for ethnic differences, children from low-SES families were half as likely as other children to be identified."
252,2010.0,Developmental Changes in Processing Speed: Influence of Accelerated Education for Gifted Children,"Developmental Changes in Processing Speed: Influence of Accelerated Education for Gifted Children gifted children; speed of information processing (SIP); accelerated education; development There are two major hypotheses concerning the developmental trends of processing speeds. These hypotheses explore both local and global trends. The study presented here investigates the effects of people's different knowledge on the speed with which they are able to process information. The participants in this study are gifted children aged 9, 11, and 13 years. A total of 94 of the participants were members of gifted programs, whereas the other 93 children received standard education. They were required to finish two information-processing tasks: a Choice Reaction Time task and an Abstract Matching task. The results show that the reaction time of gifted children who received accelerated education in gifted programs was significantly faster than that of the children who received standard education at every age. These results seem to imply that the educational atmosphere in which a child is placed plays a significant role in the development of gifted children's speed of information processing."
253,2010.0,"Exploring the Relationship of College Freshmen Honors Students' Effort and Ability Attribution, Interest, and Implicit Theory of Intelligence With Perceived Ability","Exploring the Relationship of College Freshmen Honors Students' Effort and Ability Attribution, Interest, and Implicit Theory of Intelligence With Perceived Ability interest; achievement; ability; effort; implicit theory of intelligence Although there are several explanations for why one succeeds or fails, effort and ability are the major causes that students report. The purpose of the present study was to measure the perceptions of 149 college freshmen enrolled in a university honors program about their skills in 15 talent areas. In addition, this study explored the relationship of interests and ability and effort attributions with self-efficacy and investigated gender differences in these perceptions. There was a positive relationship between students' interest in a talent area and their assessment of their skill in that area. The strongest relationships tended to be in nonacademic areas. For some talents, males placed stronger attributions on the role that natural ability played, whereas females indicated that personal effort contributed to high levels of performance. Participants' implicit theory of intelligence did not appear to influence their perceptions of the importance of ability in academic performance."
254,2010.0,Cognitive and Psychosocial Characteristics of Gifted Students With Written Language Disability,"Cognitive and Psychosocial Characteristics of Gifted Students With Written Language Disability gifted students; disorder of written expression; specific learning disabilities Gifted and talented students who also have a specific learning disability (SLD) are typically referred to as twice-exceptional and are among the most underserved students in our schools. Previous special education laws promoted a wait-to-fail approach; therefore, gifted students with SLD often were overlooked because their average academic performance was not failure enough. The flip side to this was the fact that students' giftedness, as measured by general ability tests, often was masked by average, yet relatively weak, academic achievement. They were not only waiting to fail, they were failing to flourish. The authors present the data gathered from 14 gifted students with SLD, specifically a disorder of written expression. Students were determined to be gifted if they earned a score of 120 (Superior) on the Verbal Scale of a cognitive ability test. They were considered to have a written language disability through an evaluation of their written language skills. The average Verbal IQ for the group was close to a standard score of 130, whereas the average Written Language Score was close to a standard score of 99. In addition to the cognitive profile for these students, the authors obtained measures of their psychosocial functioning. On average, parents, teachers, and students reported typical adaptive behavior, yet group elevations also were present on several clinical scales. The authors' main conclusion is that a comprehensive assessment plays a critical role in (a) determining whether a student is twice-exceptional, (b) identifying the possibility of psychosocial concerns, and (c) developing educational recommendations."
255,2010.0,High Achievement on Advanced Placement Exams: The Relationship of School-Level Contextual Factors to Performance,"High Achievement on Advanced Placement Exams: The Relationship of School-Level Contextual Factors to Performance high achievement; Advanced Placement; hierarchical regression The purpose of the study was to identify school- and district-level variables that relate to advanced academic achievement, as defined by the ratio of number of scores of 3, 4, or 5 on Advanced Placement exams to school enrollment. The study initially included 46 variables for 339 public high schools in one Midwestern state. Hierarchical linear regressions were applied to 14 and then 7 independent variables, explaining 80% of the variance in advanced academic achievement among high schools. Findings indicate that after accounting for seemingly fixed factors, schools and districts can still contribute significantly in the development of advanced academic achievement. Implications for educators and policy makers are discussed."

Gifted adolescents in college-preparatory high school programs may be faced with novel stressors, and may have unique coping strategies to manage these challenges. The current study considers responses to surveys of stress and coping as well as focus group interviews of gifted and high-achieving students enrolled in an academically intense curriculum, the International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma Program. Findings of this secondary analysis of archival data sets indicate gifted students experience levels of stress similar to their IB classmates not identified as gifted. Additionally, gifted students were similar to IB peers not identified as gifted with respect to how they cope with school; likenesses included positive reframing, time and task management, avoiding tasks, and seeking social support. However, gifted IB students differed from IB classmates with respect to anger coping, humor, and problem-solving approaches."

A grounded analysis of their narratives revealed the following themes: (a) importance of family relationships, (b) perceptions on school and intelligence, (c) predominant characterization of heroes, (d) peer relationships, and (e) concerns related to God and spirituality. Significant differences in the narratives of the public and private school children are also examined. The implications of using projective measures as a window to gifted children's socio-affective concerns are discussed."
258,2010.0,Dealing With Dependence (Part I): Understanding the Effects of Clustered Data,"Dealing With Dependence (Part I): Understanding the Effects of Clustered Data interclass correlation; clustered data; hierarchical linear modeling; gifted education research This article provides a conceptual introduction to the issues surrounding the analysis of clustered (nested) data. We define the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and the design effect, and we explain their effect on the standard error. When the ICC is greater than 0, then the design effect is greater than 1. In such a scenario, the standard error produced under the assumption of independence is underestimated. This increases the Type I error rate. We provide a short illustration of the effect of non-independence on the standard error. We show that after accounting for the design effect, our decision about the statistical significance of the test statistic changes. When we fail to account for the clustered nature of the data, we conclude that the difference between the two groups is statistically significant. However, once we adjust the standard error for the design effect, the difference is no longer statistically significant."

Clusters of adolescents were formed on the basis of their overexcitabilities, and these clusters of adolescents were then compared with regard to their self-concept scores. Gender differences were also examined. The sample consisted of 379 gifted adolescents, ranging in age from 11 to 16 years of age. Forms of overexcitabilities were measured using the Overexcitabilities Questionnaire-II, and various facets of self-concept were measured using the Self-Description Questionnaire-II. Using cluster analysis, multivariate analysis of variance, and chi-square analysis, results suggested a distinct four-cluster solution, as well as differences between clusters in self-concept and gender."

The gifted sample included 25 high school and college students who were selected because they were in a gifted program in elementary school. The talent sample included 41 high school students who were selected because they were highly involved in athletics and the arts in middle childhood. The authors found that passion was more characteristic of participation in nonacademic activities (i.e., sports and the arts). Talented youth were more likely to talk about wanting to do their activity all the time, experiencing flow, getting emotional release from participation, and internalizing the activity into their identity. The authors also found that school settings, and especially regular classrooms as compared with gifted and advanced classes, appeared to undermine rather that support passion. The authors discuss implications of their findings for creating school environments that can foster passion."

Surprisingly, the vast majority of literature reviews and background sections of research articles include studies that do not directly compare gifted and nongifted youth. Furthermore, almost no attention has been paid to how differences in the definitions of giftedness or mental health outcomes of interest affect the interpretation and comparison of studies. The authors apply an epidemiologic perspective for thinking about these issues, highlight many of the challenges of studying this population, and present results from meta-analyses that include the most methodologically rigorous studies comparing rates of depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety, suicide ideation, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) between gifted and nongifted youth. They conclude with recommendations to strengthen research in this area."

Counseling; best practices; school counseling; high school students; visual and performing arts; humanities; adolescents; quantitative methods School counselors play a vital role in meeting the needs of gifted students in their buildings. However, because there is a lack of structured, standardized, and empirically tested best practices for counseling gifted students, school counselors may not know how best to serve this unique population. The purpose of this study was to investigate gifted and talented adolescents' experiences with the counseling techniques, strategies, and approaches most frequently cited in the gifted education literature in order to determine if any of these best practices were actually occurring. Few of these best practices were experienced by gifted and talented adolescents surveyed. School counselor preparation programs should consider providing training curriculum that addresses issues unique to the learning and development of gifted students."

Item difficulty estimates and person ability estimates located on the same logit scale revealed that the pooled sample of Chinese students, who were relatively highly able, might find it relatively easy to complete the IFT, and there might be relatively fewer number of items at the higher end than at the lower end of the item difficulty scale. The substantial correlation between person ability estimates and external criterion measures (mental rotation test scores and judged drawing scores) provided support for the validity of the IFT in identifying visual-spatial talents among students. Implications of the findings for the use and the future development or refinement of the IFT are discussed."

This article provides an overview of the literature on difficulties experienced by parents of gifted and talented children, followed by a description of the development of a parenting program designed specifically for this population. Qualitative data from a survey of parents of gifted and talented children are presented to identify key themes for supporting and assisting parents. Gifted and Talented Triple P is a customized version of Triple P-Positive Parenting Program, consisting of nine sessions, specifically tailored for the needs of parents of gifted and talented children. The program is described and the clinical implications and future research directions in assisting parents in parenting their gifted and talented child are discussed."

Confirmatory factor analyses supported a five-dimensional model that includes constructs of personal standards, parental expectations, parental criticism, concern over mistakes and doubts, and organization. Clustering procedures yielded three clusters of students interpreted as unhealthy perfectionists, healthy perfectionists, and nonperfectionists. Unhealthy perfectionists had pervasively high scores on all five dimensions, healthy perfectionists scored high on standards and organization and low on parental criticism and concern over mistakes and doubts, and nonperfectionists had pervasively low scores on all five dimensions. Implications of the findings for future research on perfectionism and the promotion of positive perfectionism are discussed."

This article describes the development of the units and reports on mathematics achievement results for students in Grades 3 to 5 from I I urban and suburban schools after exposure to the curriculum. Data analyses indicate statistically significant differences favoring each of the experimental groups over the comparison group on the ITBS (Iowa Tests of Basic Skills) Concepts and Estimation Test and on Open-Response Assessments at all three grade levels. Furthermore, the effect sizes range from 0.29 to 0.59 on the ITBS Concepts and Estimation Scale and 0.69 to 0.97 on the Open-Response Assessments. These results indicate that these units, designed to address the needs of mathematically promising students, positively affected their achievement."

A total of 166 students were selected from nine gifted classes in the public school system with after-school enrichment programs in Korea. Students responded to self-report measures of mastery-oriented learning goals, self-efficacy, self-regulatory strategy use, and inquiry activities in science class. Performance data were obtained from work on a scientific inquiry task. Results of a path analysis revealed that Students' self-efficacy and perceived degree of inquiry activities in science class were the only factors directly influencing their scientific inquiry skills. Whereas open inquiry learning that allows for choices and decisions in students' inquiry procedure directly influenced use of self-regulatory strategies, the extent of inquiry activities directly influenced self-efficacy. Self-regulatory strategy use was not a significant predictor for scientific inquiry skills. Based on the results, implications for future science gifted education are discussed."

Many top journals have required that effect sizes accompany claims of statistical significance. However, too often reports of data analyses in gifted education rely on statistical significance without reporting effect size indices to help interpret quantitative findings. Without a supporting effect size index, erroneous interpretation of results can occur. This Methodological Brief addresses this concern and provides examples and guidance concerning using effect sizes in gifted education quantitative research."

Gifted dyads were reassessed on friendship quality and stability at the end of the school year and after the summer. Gifted students were more task-oriented and comparison students more other-referenced. Task-orientation was related to fewer friendship conflicts, more friendly competition, and, for gifted students, greater friendship stability. Being other-referenced was related to negative friendship qualities and unstable friendships regardless of sex, grade, or program, and instability in gifted female students' friendships. Friends reporting positive friendship qualities at the end of the school year more likely remained friends over the summer. Comparison group friendships had more numerous positive qualities (companionship, help, security, closeness) than those of gifted adolescents. Competitive goal orientation rather than competition itself affects friendship success."
292,2009.0,Profoundly Gifted Girls and Autism Spectrum Disorder A Psychometric Case Study Comparison,"Profoundly Gifted Girls and Autism Spectrum Disorder A Psychometric Case Study Comparison Twice-exceptional; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Social Impairments, Profoundly Gifted A case study of the psychometric characteristics of two profoundly gifted girls, one with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and the other without ASD, is used to describe the nuances and subtleties most relevant in understanding the relationship between extreme giftedness and social difficulties. Through the presentation of the results from psychoeducational and psychosocial assessments, we demonstrate how data from a comprehensive evaluation can distinguish between the manifestation of extreme giftedness and concomitant social impairment indicative of ASD. Comparison of the assessment results highlights the relevance of cognitive and achievement information as well as the need for specific measures to diagnosis ASD. The girls demonstrated virtually identically superior cognitive and achievement performances. However, an in-depth analysis of additional measures, especially those specific to ASD, indicates that information about adaptive behavior and executive functioning can reveal important distinctions that are helpful in understanding the need for unique interventions specific to ASD."

Twenty-one toddlers were videotaped in monthly play sessions with their mothers, from age 8 to 17 months, and later assessed at 5 years of age on the Stanford-Binet IV. Children's and mothers' pretend play levels and frequencies were measured using Brown's (1997) Pretend Play Observation Scale. Dyadic play activity was analyzed using the conceptual frameworks of scaffolding and Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD). Toddlers later assessed as having higher IQ demonstrated more rapid teaming in the ZPD for pretend play and experienced earlier maternal transfer of responsibility for play. These findings support other evidence on the differential early development of high ability or gifted children and the role of caregiver interactions in that development."
294,2009.0,Racial and Ethnic Representation in Gifted Programs Current Status of and Implications for Gifted Asian American Students,"Racial and Ethnic Representation in Gifted Programs Current Status of and Implications for Gifted Asian American Students Gifted; Race; Ethnicity; Asian American; Representation; Identification; Underrepresentation The Elementary and Secondary School Survey data and Civil Rights Data Collection of the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) were analyzed to describe the issue of overrepresentation of gifted Asian American students in gifted education programs in the United States. Nationally, Asian and Whites have been overrepresented in gifted education since 1978, whereas, students from other ethnic backgrounds, such as those from American Indian or Alaska Native, Hispanic, and African American groups, have been underrepresented with gradual increases in this underrepresentation since 1994. When the data were disaggregated by state for the period from 2002 to 2006, each racial and ethnic group displayed varied ranges of representation. Those varied distributions can be attributed to each state's unique demographic profile, varied definitions of giftedness, identification procedures, and identification policies. By focusing on Asian American students, this study addressed some difficulties that gifted Asian American students may face concerning the image of model minority and through the acculturation processes as immigrants or descendents of immigrants. Furthermore, this study suggests a need for disaggregated data collection and more research concerning gifted Asian American students from various ethnic Asian groups."

This study examines the experience and perceptions of 14 student participants in the program and their parents. In student and parent interviews, Project EXCITE was deemed fun and challenging and as enabling the students to enrich and improve academic performance. A desire for placement in advanced academic settings and better preparation for schoolwork in high school motivated the students to persist in the program for 6 years. The perceptions of expanded social networks with high ability minority peers, enhanced social support for high achievement, and confidence to successfully compete academically with peers were other positive outcomes. Negative peer pressure was not identified as a concern, but balancing academic work and social interaction with peers outside the program was a major concern for students."

Historically, research and education of the gifted has focused on cognitive variables, with less attention given to the social and emotional needs of these students. The current study used data from the full Add Health data set to examine how protective factors moderated depression differently for gifted and nongifted adolescents. Results of the study indicate that gifted students are significantly less depressed than nongifted students, and all of the protective factors moderated depression for both groups. Future research should examine additional indicators of psychosocial well-being provide a more comprehensive framework for understanding the social and emotional development of gifted and nongifted adolescents."

Based on these judges' verbalization to make explicit their implicit criteria for judgments, a set of guidelines containing these criteria was developed for nonexpert or lay judges. The substantial and significant correlations between global ratings by lay judges and expert judges on the drawings of a separate sample of 105 students provided evidence that the guidelines were useful in helping nonexperts closely replicate expert judgments rendered by visual artists. Implications of the findings for the identification of visual arts talents in the school setting are discussed."

This study attempts to understand how attendance at a residential high school (academy) may affect academically gifted students over time. Students in two graduating classes at the academy completed the Social Coping Questionnaire on two (class of 2006) or three (class of 2005) occasions during their 2 years at the academy. Significant differences across approximately the first year at the academy are found for the items denying giftedness (more common after a year at the academy), social interaction (less common after a year at the academy), and peer acceptance (higher after a year at the academy)."
299,2009.0,"A Longitudinal Study of Negative Life Events, Stress, and School Experiences of Gifted Youth","A Longitudinal Study of Negative Life Events, Stress, and School Experiences of Gifted Youth gifted; negative life events; stress; achievement; qualitative An 11-year mixed-methods, cross-sectional longitudinal study began with a group of 121 children, identified as gifted, and followed them until high-school graduation. Parents annually identified negative life events experienced by child and family, and, at graduation, students completed an open-ended retrospective questionnaire, focusing on events, impact of events, supports, and hindrances during the school years. As a result of attrition, participants became increasingly homogeneous over time. School data were available for 59 students (of 63 family units who sustained involvement) at the end. The students had experienced many negative events and situations during the school years. However, they usually cited academic challenges, school transitions, peer relationships, and overcommitment as their most challenging experiences, not life events. Almost without exception, they maintained high achievement."

In 357 students from 18 secondary schools, we measured self-concept, sociometric status, and behavior reputations at three times. Accelerated students had more positive self-concepts concerning school in general and mathematics than nonaccelerated students, but a less positive social self-concept. In girls but not in boys, the difference in social self-concept of accelerated and nonaccelerated students was no longer present at the end of the 2nd year. Accelerated students had a lower social status than nonaccelerants and were considered to be less cooperative, humorous, helpful, leading, and social. peer ratings were more negative for accelerated boys than for accelerated girls. Implications for the education of accelerated students, including the social emotional development of accelerated students in their 1st years of secondary school, are discussed."
301,2008.0,"Identifying academically gifted English-language learners using nonverbal tests - A comparison of the Raven, NNAT, and CogAT","Identifying academically gifted English-language learners using nonverbal tests - A comparison of the Raven, NNAT, and CogAT identification; English-language learners; nonverbal tests In this study, the authors compare the validity of three nonverbal tests for the purpose of identifying academically gifted English-language learners (ELLs). Participants were 1,198 elementary children (approximately 40% ELLs). All were administered the Raven Standard Progressive Matrices (Raven), the Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test (NNAT), and Form 6 of the Cognitive Abilities Test (CogAT). Results show that the U.S. national norms for the Raven substantially overestimate the number of high-scoring children; that because of errors in norming, the NNAT overestimates the number of both high-scoring and low-scoring children; that primary-level ELL children score especially poorly on the NNAT; that the standard error of measurement was twice as large for the NNAT as for the Raven or the CogAT; that ELL children scored .5 to .67 standard deviations lower than non-ELL children on the three nonverbal tests; and that none of the nonverbal tests predict achievement for ELL students very well. Putting Research to Use: Do nonverbal reasoning tests level the field for ELL children? Many practitioners have assumed that they do. However ELL children in this study scored 8 to 10 points lower than non-ELL children on the three nonverbal tests. The study also shows that practitioners cannot assume that national norms on the tests are of comparable quality. When put on the same scale as CogAT, Raven scores averaged 10 points higher than CogAT and NNAT scores. For NNAT, the mean is correct but the variability was up to 40% too large. Thus, when using national norms, both the Raven and NNAT will substantially overestimate the number of high-scoring children."
302,2008.0,A study of differentiated instructional change over 3 years,"A study of differentiated instructional change over 3 years differentiated instruction; classroom observation scale; longitudinal change of instructional behavior This study examines Title 1 heterogeneous classroom teachers' instructional behavior change through implementing well-designed research-based curriculum units and attending regular professional development activities across 3 years. Employing an experimental design, this study compares experimental and comparison teachers' behavioral changes as measured by an observation scale of differentiated teaching strategies across 3 years. The results show that experimental teachers received statistically significant and educationally important higher ratings than comparison teachers on differentiated strategy use and effectiveness across 3 years. The study corroborates the research literature that shows that teachers' instructional improvement takes 2 years to manifest its effectiveness and to shape belief in student learning benefits. Putting the Research to Use: This study suggests several areas of practical application. One areas is in the reality versus the myth of professional development. These data suggest the need for multiple years of professional development, interspersed with observations that track the frequency and efficacy of targeting instructional behaviours. Thus, educational reformers must be clear about what change they want teachers to achieve and set about a 2- to 3-year plan for making it happen at the school level. This study also lends support to more systematic approaches to encouraging differentiation. It highlights the need for monitoring classroom implementation. The use of a well-validated observation tool such as the Classroom Observation Scale-Revised provides a venue for ongoing instructional monitoring and improvement. Moreover, embedding content pedagogy in actual curriculum for training reduces the chance for inaccurate teacher inferencing about how to employ a strategy effectively."
303,2008.0,You Could Be Doing Brain Surgery: Gifted girls becoming teachers,"You Could Be Doing Brain Surgery: Gifted girls becoming teachers gifted; female; careers; teaching This qualitative study focuses on messages to gifted girls about their choice of a career in teaching. Participants consisted of 18 female teachers identified as gifted. The methodology consisted of semistructured interviews and focus group discussions. Findings indicate that messages of discouragement toward a career in teaching Z, were more numerous and more emphatic than were messages of encouragement. Despite this, these participants were content with and remained committed to teaching careers for the foreseeable future. Participants also mentioned a variety of ways in which their giftedness interacted with their teaching, for their own benefit and that of their students. Recommendations for counselors, teachers, and parents include providing information about the entire range of career options and carefully matching career pathways with the student's interests and dreams rather than the adult's preconceived notions of success or prestige. Putting the Research to Use: There is little question that our society desperately needs teachers who are gifted. Yet gifted students who express an interest in a teaching career are often discouraged by family members, friends, teachers, and counselors. Although it is appropriate to encourage gifted students to pursue careers that might be perceived by society as more prestigious than teaching, it is counterproductive to guide students into careers inconsistent with their interests and values. By the time they are in high school, students who are interested in teaching have often sought out opportunities to interact with children and have engaged in activities such as playing school. These activities indicate the desire to teach, a desire that should be taken seriously. As Delisle (1998, p. 21) put it, My hope is that... we will lecture less and listen more, giving academic and career guidance based upon individual interest patterns rather than preordained societal benchmarks of success. In addition, students should engage in discussions regarding ways in which their intellectual talents may be challenged in teaching to the benefit of all."
304,2008.0,The psychology of gifted adolescents as measured by the MMPI-A,"The psychology of gifted adolescents as measured by the MMPI-A gifted adolescents; personality; MMPI-A The focus of this study is an examination of gifted students' responses on the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-Adolescent (MMPI-A) in relation to the adolescent norming sample. The comparisons on clinical, content, and Harris-Lingoes scales provide evidence that gifted adolescent boys' and girls' responses do not differ from one another significantly. Furthermore, the data reveal that the assumption held by many that gifted adolescents are more prone to experience heightened rates of neuroticism or personality difficulties is unsupported by the empirical data. Analyses of MMPI-A scores reveal that gifted students' scores are equivalent to or lower than the general population in all areas. The results are discussed as continued empirical evidence that gifted adolescents do not demonstrate abnormal levels of psychological or personality deviance because of their elevated cognitive abilities. Putting the Research to Work: Educators often subscribe to the notion that gifted adolescents are prone to more neurotic behavior or are more often diagnosed with personality disorders than their age mates. The results of this research indicate that notion is false, particularly for adolescents in a residential academy. Educators should be cognizant of the characteristics and needs of gifted adolescents and use that knowledge in planning services and identification plans for these students."
305,2008.0,Do contributors to intellect explain the moral judgment abilities of gifted youth?,"Do contributors to intellect explain the moral judgment abilities of gifted youth? middle school; age/developmental stage; high school; college or adult To assess reaction time and attributional complexity as factors contributing to the relatively high moral judgment of gifted youth, a sample of 30 gifted youth and 30 college students responded to a computerized measure of moral judgment development, which also indexed reaction time. Additionally, participants completed a measurement of attributional complexity and reported American College Test (ACT) scores. Statistically significant differences favored the gifted in moral judgment development, reaction time, and attributional complexity. Regression analysis revealed that attributional complexity explained a significant amount of variance, whereas ACT scores and reaction times accounted for minimal variance. Although reaction time did not predict moral judgment developmental difference, discussion is offered to suggest how gifted youth, such as those in this study, might benefit from using their reaction time when considering moral situations. Putting the Research to Use: The results of this study support the view that complex information processing and reaction time abilities of gifted youth are transferred to their moral judgment development. In sum, in comparison with a control group of college students, the gifted youth considered in this study appeared to process reasons for moral decisions in a more in-depth manner and were able to do so in a more efficient manner. Currently, it is unknown why and how this occurs, whether obstacles exist that could block this process, and whether practices exist that could help to facilitate these areas. Applications of these findings should therefore expound on these issues so that the utility of research on gifted moral judgment ability is increased. Applied research should also focus on transferring this understanding to general populations in the hopes of affecting the understanding of moral judgment development overall."

This qualitative study investigated an exemplary CTE center and the experiences of the rural secondary students who were identified as talented in this setting. Four themes emerged and paralleled suggested practices in gifted education: individualization, student-centered meaningful choices, instructors as developers of talent, and participation in career and technical student organizations. Results offer methods that secondary educators can use to recognize and identify talented CTE students and engage them in challenging, meaningful learning. Findings of positive experiences of talented students in this setting led to the conclusions that CTE programs should be included as part of the continuum of services for gifted and talented youth and that CTE programs should identify, recognize, and serve gifted and talented students."

This qualitative study investigates how a broad range of gifted secondary students perceives and evaluates the curriculum, instruction, and environments within AP and IB courses. Interviews with 200 students in 23 U.S. high schools revealed that although students believe that AP and IB courses provide a greater level of academic challenge and more favorable learning environments than other existing high school courses, the curriculum and instruction within AP and IB courses are not a good fit for all learners, particularly those from traditionally underserved populations. Recommendations for increasing the fit of AP and IB courses for-and consequently for increasing the participation of-students from traditionally underserved populations are discussed."
308,2008.0,Teachers' negative affect toward academically gifted students,"Teachers' negative affect toward academically gifted students negative teacher attitudes; gifted students; evolutionary psychology A frequent reason for teachers not making special provisions for a gifted child is that the child is not fitting in socially. The conjecture that a psychological source of such negative affect has evolved along with human language was tested with a large sample (N = 377) of teachers in England, Scotland, and Australia who were undertaking continuing professional development (CPD) in gifted education. Quantitative indicators of teachers' subconscious feelings toward gifted children were measured using a five-dimensional semantic differential instrument. Oblique factor analysis produced a three-factor structure, namely, general characteristics of gifted children including high cognitive abilities, social misfits, and antisocial leaders. Teachers' negative affect toward gifted children concerns the potential use of high intelligence toward social noncompliance. The factor scores for teachers completing the CPD programs were lower for the social noncompliance factors and higher for the general factor compared with scores of teachers commencing the programs."

Participants included 100 high-ability college students and 196 average-ability college students enrolled in a comprehensive university in the South. Data analysis estimates of internal consistency were moderate, and estimates of relationships with external validity criteria, namely, academic achievement, aspirations, and year in school, moderately supported the validity of each subscale. Results indicate some support for the use of each subscale with highability college students."

In the current study, Cox's (1926) findings regarding 301 geniuses were replicated on a sample of 291 eminent African Americans. Relative genius was measured by two archival eminence measures (majority White and minority Black culture) and by scores on die Creative Achievement Scale (Ludwig, 1992). Giftedness was assessed by raters blind to the identity of the individuals being evaluated. Control variables were defined for gender, year of birth, status as a living contemporary, and 18 domains of achievement. Multiple regression analyses indicated that adulthood eminence and creative achievement are positively correlated with early giftedness, with an effect size comparable to that found in the Cox study. Furthermore, this association was not moderated by gender, birth year, or most of the remaining variables."

The purpose was to understand parents' perspectives on the early entrance experience, including reasons for choosing early entrance, satisfaction with their children's program, perceived advantages and disadvantages of early entrance, and the effect of early entrance on family relationships. Ninety-five parents participated, with the majority reporting great satisfaction with multiple aspects of their and their children's experience. Early Entrance Program parents expressed a slightly higher degree of satisfaction than did Academy parents. This study suggests that early university entrance is an attractive option for parents willing to follow the lead of their talented and ambitious adolescents."

This principle underlying general human development is also applicable to the development of gifted and talented behaviors. These behaviors are dynamic because persons demonstrating such behaviors are forming dynamic, functional relations with a specific environment, with unique temporal trajectories capable of engendering emergent properties that feed into further development. This Contextual, Emergent, and Dynamic Model provides an alternative to traditional static, reductionistic, trait-based conceptions of giftedness. The article further elaborates on three dynamic facets of the making of gifted potential: selective affinity, maximal grip, and being at the edge of chaos. These facets allow for dealing with the genesis of talents, developing expertise over an extended period, and developing creative potential."

This qualitative study investigated methods to increase successful participation of CLED students in gifted programs across the nation. Twenty-five programs were selected for inclusion in the study. Of those, 7 programs were selected for in-depth site visits that included interviews with administrators and teachers, as well as observations. Data suggested five categories that contributed to the successful identification and participation of CLED students in gifted programs. These categories included modified identification procedures; program support systems, such as front-loading (identifying high-potential children and providing opportunities for advanced work prior to formal identification); selecting curriculum/instructional designs that enable CLED students to succeed; building parent/home connections; and using program evaluation practices designed to highlight avenues to CLED students' success."

Giftedness was conceptualized as nonverbal reasoning ability and defined by a rank of at least 95% on a nonverbal reasoning subscale of the German Cognitive Abilities Test. Mathematical achievement was measured by teacher-assigned grades and a standardized mathematics test. Self-concept, interest, and motivation were assessed by questionnaire. In both ability groups, boys earned significantly higher test scores but there were no gender differences in grades. Girls scored lower on measures of academic self-concept, interest, and motivation. Gender differences were larger in gifted than in average-ability students. Ability group differences for self-concept and interest were only found for boys in favor of the gifted. Results support the assumption that gender differences in self-concept, interest, and motivation in mathematics are more prevalent in gifted than in average-ability students."
317,2008.0,Validation of the Gifted Rating Scales-School Form in China,"Validation of the Gifted Rating Scales-School Form in China gifted rating scales; Chinese children; reliability; validity The Gifted Rating Scales-School Form (GRS-S), a teacher-completed rating scale, is designed to identify five types of giftedness and motivation. This study examines the reliability and validity of a Chinese-translated version of the GRS-S with a sample of Chinese elementary and middle school students (N = 499). The Chinese GRSS was found to have high internal consistency. Results of the confirmatory factor analysis corroborated the six-factor solution of the original GRS-S. Comparison of the GRS-S scores and measures of academic performance provide preliminary support for the criterion validity of the Chinese-translated GRS-S. Significant age and gender differences on the Chinese GRS-S were found. Results provide preliminary support for the Chinese version of the GRS-S as a reliable and valid measure of giftedness for Chinese students."
318,2008.0,Academically talented students' attitudes toward service in the community,"Academically talented students' attitudes toward service in the community academically talented youth; service learning; service activities; minority youth In this study, the authors examined participation rates in, and attitudes toward, service in community settings in a sample of 936 academically talented adolescents. Results indicated that about 50% of the participants participated in both classroom-sponsored and organization-sponsored service activities, with female students reporting higher rates than male students. Participation rates increased with increases in socioeconomic status, and rates in organization-sponsored activities increased across grade levels. Attitudes toward service were generally positive, with female students having more positive attitudes than male students. These findings mirror results from studies of non-identified students and suggest that differences in participation rates in service activities may be reflecting differences in economic circumstances that allow for participation."

The students were asked to read one sentence at a time and report their thoughts verbally. Their verbalizations were analyzed for evidence of how they used metacognitive skills. The older students actively monitored and evaluated their comprehension as they tried to make sense of the text but were more willing to accept problematic text. The younger students were not as active in monitoring their comprehension, but they were less likely to accept the prior knowledge violations."

The Gifted Rating Scales-Preschool/Kindergarten Form (GRS-P) is based on a multidimensional model of giftedness. An examination of the standardization sample using diagnostic efficiency statistics provides support for the diagnostic accuracy of the GRS-P Intellectual Ability and Academic Ability scales identifying intellectual giftedness, irrespective of the IQ cut score used to demarcate giftedness. The present findings extend the analysis of the standardization sample reported in the test manual and provide additional support for the GRS-P as a gifted screening tool."

Thirty-two Head Start and state-funded Pre-K children completed the Torrance creativity test Thinking Creatively in Action and Movement (TCAM). The children's private speech was collected in an open play context and while children completed structured logical-mathematical activities. Results revealed that both originality and fluency creativity were related to self-direction private speech and grand total private speech. Findings support that cognitive self-regulating private speech may be related to creative thinking and that private speech may offer a method for assessing early creative thinking in children from various cultural and economic backgrounds.
322,2008.0,Giftedness of Chinese students in Hong Kong - Perspectives from different conceptions of intelligences,"Giftedness of Chinese students in Hong Kong - Perspectives from different conceptions of intelligences giftedness; multiple intelligences; emotional intelligence; successful intelligence; profile types This study examined the self-perceived intelligences (multiple intelligences, emotional intelligence, and successful intelligence) of 498 Chinese gifted students in Hong Kong. Based on the associations among perceived intelligence scores, three dimensions could be distinguished to describe giftedness and could be interpreted as global giftedness, socioemotional giftedness, and artistic giftedness. Using profiles of perceived intelligences, students could be classified as falling into four clusters of supersmart students, socioemotionally gifted students, modest gifted students, and artistically gifted students. The supersmart students engaged in more activities related to leadership and creativity than the other clusters of students, with the modest gifted students reporting the least engagement. The supersmart students, however, were rated by teachers as less emotionally mature, showing less concern for others, and more likely to have behavioral conduct problems than the socioemotionally gifted students. Implications of the findings for conceptualizing giftedness and working with different groups of gifted students are discussed."
323,2008.0,A national picture of talent search and talent search educational programs,"A national picture of talent search and talent search educational programs talent search; talent search educational programs; talent search centers This article presents a comprehensive portrait of talent search testing and associated educational programs in the United States, now some 35 years after Dr. Julian Stanley originated the concept. Survey data from the six major talent search centers in the United States were used to examine the scope of talent search educational offerings, including accelerated summer, distance education, Saturday and weekend, and leadership programs. Reported data reveal that over 3 million students have participated in talent search testing since these programs' inception, and subsequently thousands of these students participate each year in other educational programs offered by these organizations. In addition to above-level test scores, data used to prequalify students to participate include on-level standardized achievement tests, teacher or parent nominations, and portfolios. Disproportional representations within talent search testing and educational programs by racial and household income levels were addressed with a need for more financial support and collaborative work between talent search centers and local schools for more students to benefit from the talent search model."

Given the widespread use of the Harter Self-Perception Profiles for Children and Adolescents, the purposes of this study were to replicate reliability studies of the Self-Perception Profile for Children in a sample of gifted students, to assess the reliability of gifted students' scores on the Self-Perception Profile for Adolescents, and to examine the validity of scores on both instruments for use with gifted populations. Results provide evidence of validity and reliability for use with gifted populations."

Perry posits that intellectual development proceeds from a basic dualism through nine stages (positions) and culminates with a sense of personal identify and commitment. Perry suggests that the college years act as the agent of intellectual development, but others have argued that Perry's scheme is not flexible enough to account for gender- and culture-based differences. This study uses a paper-and-pencil questionnaire to describe developmental characteristics of gifted high school students and examines between-group differences between gender and ethnic groups at the high school sophomore and senior years. All groups showed significant improvement from sophomore to senior year. There were no differences by gender or ethnicity at the sophomore year, but by senior year, significant. developmental differences existed among ethnic groups."

Empirical, or evidence-based, research can be quantitative or qualitative (or mixed methods); it also can be interventional or non-interventional. An explanation and example of each type of empirical evidence are provided, along with key guidelines for reviewing and judging each one. Next, the authors offer general considerations for evaluating specific components of research, regardless of the type of study (e.g., source of evidence, research design, research questions, effect size, sample, instrumentation). Considerations for judging meta-analyses are also offered."
330,2007.0,"The talent search model: Past, present, and future","The talent search model: Past, present, and future talent search; above-level testing; academic acceleration; ceiling effect; DT -> PI model Typical standardized achievement tests cannot provide accurate information about gifted students' abilities because they are not challenging enough for such students. Talent searches solve this problem through above-level testing-using tests designed for older students to raise the ceiling for younger, gifted students. Currently, talent search pro-rams serve gifted students from grades 2 through 8 throughout the mainland United States and in several foreign countries. Extensive research demonstrates that above-level test scores differentiate among levels of giftedness and have important implications for educational planning. Students with high scores learn advanced material rapidly and well and thrive in accelerated learning settings. Therefore, talent searches have followed up on testing with educational programs, many of which focus on acceleration. Decades of research have documented both academic and psychosocial benefits to participants. Perhaps the greatest challenge ahead of the talent searches is that of facilitating the appropriate education of gifted students in the school setting."
331,2007.0,The socioaffective impact of acceleration and ability grouping: Recommendations for best practice,"The socioaffective impact of acceleration and ability grouping: Recommendations for best practice peer ability grouping; social; emotional; acceleration Although the academic gains associated with acceleration and peer ability grouping are well documented, resistance to their use for gifted students continues because of concerns that such practices will cause social or emotional harm to students. Results from the broad research indicate that grade skipping, early school entrance, and early admission to college have socioaffective benefits for gifted students who are selected on the basis of demonstrated academic, social, and emotional maturity, but may be harmful to unselected students who are arbitrarily accelerated on the basis of IQ, achievement, or social maturity. There is little research on the socioaffective effects of peer ability grouping. The limited evidence indicates strong benefits for highly gifted students and possibly for some minority or disadvantaged gifted students. Robust evidence does not exist to support the idea that heterogeneous classroom grouping per se significantly increases the risk for adjustment problems among moderately gifted students. Recommendations for best practice based on the available evidence are presented."
332,2007.0,Toward best practice: An analysis of the efficacy of curriculum models in gifted education,"Toward best practice: An analysis of the efficacy of curriculum models in gifted education curriculum models; research-based evidence of effectiveness; differentiated curriculum for the gifted This article provides an overview of existing research on I I curriculum models in the field of gifted education, including the schoolwide enrichment model and the talent search model, and several others that have been used to shape high-level learning experiences for gifted students. The models are critiqued according to the key features they contribute to student learning, teacher use, and contextual fit, including alignment to standards and use with special populations of gifted and nongifted learners. The authors also provide a set of key principles derived from the research studies on what has been learned as a field about curriculum and instruction for the gifted. The article concludes with a set of practical considerations for educators in implementing any of the curricula analyzed and specific district applications of the Integrated Curriculum Model (ICM) that illustrate effective implementation over time."
333,2007.0,Cognitive and affective learning outcomes of gifted elementary school students,"Cognitive and affective learning outcomes of gifted elementary school students components of gifted programs; outcomes of gifted programs This project was a 2-year investigation of elementary school children placed in programs for high-ability learners. The primary purpose of the study was to investigate academic and affective changes in students during their first 2 years in a gifted program. Students were assessed during the fall of one year and the spring of the next year. Subjects were from 14 different school districts in 10 states and included African American and Caucasian/non-Hispanic students. The study compared students enrolled in gifted programs (special school, separate class, pull-out, within-class), high-achieving students from districts in which no program was available at the designated grade levels, and nongifted students in regular classrooms. This project focused on academic and affective student outcomes through multiple administrations of an achievement test, a self-perception survey, and a motivation inventory. In addition to comparing programs in general, an important dimension of the project was to examine characteristics of students from traditionally underserved populations. This was accomplished by including the variables of racial/ethnic status and the social status of participants. Results revealed that there were differences in cognitive and affective outcomes across program types. Therefore, it is strongly advised that educators conduct ongoing evaluations of their programs to be better able to monitor and address all students' needs."

Although several of the considerations derive from traditional practice in the field, some reconsideration is warranted because of more currently researched differences in how the gifted learner intellectually functions. It is argued that thinking of the gifted learner as idiosyncratic, not necessarily one of many classified as the gifted, requires a reconceptualization of how to appropriately and fully serve this unique learner. The research synthesized here covers the period from 1861 to present and represents the entire body of published research studies and representative literature (theory, program descriptions, and persuasive essays). Implications for service development and implementation are also discussed."

Targeted to identify more low-income and minority students, the identification protocol demonstrates efficacy in doing so. The study also tracks comparative data, showing the verbal and nonverbal profiles of students identified using this protocol in comparison to students more traditionally identified. Results suggest that students identified using performance tasks were more likely to be identified through the nonverbal assessment component of the tasks. Performance data are tracked across 2 years, showing that performance task-identified students, in general, perform at levels below traditionally identified students. In their area of strength, however, they tend to approach the mean for the traditionally identified gifted students on that portion of the high-stakes state test."

Participants include 294 gifted college students, 248 of whom were enrolled in an honors program and 46 who were not enrolled in an honors program. A series of analyses of covariance is used to compare the mean grade point averages, academic self-concepts, and educational aspirations of the two groups. Academic self-concept is measured using the Academic subscale of the Self Description Questionnaire III. Results indicate the gifted/honors students have higher academic achievement and higher academic self-concepts than the gifted/nonhonors students, even when controlling for SAT score. No significant differences are found with regard to aspirations. Implications are discussed."
338,2007.0,What predicts teachers' attitudes toward the gifted?,"What predicts teachers' attitudes toward the gifted? attitudes; teacher training; response effect The present study explores teachers' attitudes toward the gifted and gifted education. Specifically, the authors examine whether teachers tailor their responses about attitudes toward the gifted to fit the perceived interests of the researcher. In addition, the authors examine several potential predictors of attitudes toward the gifted: training or experience in gifted education, training or experience in special education, and self-perceptions as gifted. A total of 262 teachers participate in the study. The perceived epistemic interests of the researcher do not affect teachers' self-reported attitudes toward the gifted. Teachers who had received training in gifted education hold higher perceptions of themselves as gifted. However, teachers' self-perceptions as gifted are unrelated to their attitudes toward gifted education. Finally, special education teachers hold slightly lower attitudes toward the gifted. The authors discuss the implications of these results for the field of gifted education."

Overall, the authors find that teachers and students in all of these gifted programs express strong satisfaction with their academic programs. At the same time, however, all groups (students and teachers in gifted and regular programs at all three schools) express concerns about the relationship between the special gifted programs and the schools within which they are housed. Based on an analysis of stakeholders' concerns and suggestions in the contexts of the different schools' approaches to integration, suggestions are made for and questions are raised about fostering a positive school climate in secondary schools that offer programming for high-ability learners."

The curriculum, implemented with all students in heterogeneous classrooms, addresses state standards while integrating advanced content, higher level process emphases, and a conceptual orientation. Data collection focuses on student performance in conceptual reasoning, critical thinking, and content learning and on teacher demonstration of specific desired teaching behaviors. Results demonstrate significant and important differences between treatment and comparison groups in the area of content learning, favoring the treatment group; no significant differences are found for the small subsample of gifted students. Subanalyses yield differential results for specific units and schools, potentially indicating issues of treatment fidelity. Contextual challenges and implications of the study are discussed, including issues related to social studies curriculum implementation and differentiation in the current standards-based environment."

Psychological types are assessed with the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). The MBTI reports on four pairs of personality types: Extraversion/Introversion (E/I), Sensing/Intuition (S/N), Thinking/Feeling (T/F), and Judging/Perceiving (J/P). Overall, the most common types reported by this sample were INTJ, lNTP, INFP, ENFP, and ENTP. Comparisons between gifted and norming samples are reported. Gender differences for the gifted sample were found on E/I, with males orienting toward I and females orienting toward E. Gender-specific comparisons between gifted and norming samples reveal that gifted females had a greater tendency toward I and T, and gifted males had a greater tendency for I. Overall, both genders in the gifted sample tended to be NP types."

Participants were 418 teachers of the intellectually gifted in a southeastern state who voluntarily responded to a survey about technology attitudes. Results indicated positive attitudes toward technology, with traininc, in information technology as the greatest predictor of attitude. Age of teacher, number of classroom computers, and staff development in information technology also predicted attitudes toward information technology. The relationship of these findings with previous research of attitudes of general education teachers, implications for technology training for teachers of the gifted, and suggestions for future research are discussed."

The findings indicated the students as adolescents experienced a sense of isolation resulting from the differences between their abilities, interests, life goals, religious value systems, and the communities in which they lived. At the university, the participants discovered within the honors program an intellectual and social network with other gifted individuals like them. Together they recognized their strong desire for self-actualization. In advanced-level courses, they found intellectual stimulation and academic challenge. Through several components of the honors program they developed significant psychosocial growth. Throughout their experiences, the honors program director became a mentor and played an important role in facilitating experiences designed to address the diverse needs of these gifted young adults. Implications of the findings are presented along with suggestions for designing appropriate honors program experiences for gifted university students."

Ninety-five individuals (45%) participated. Respondents overwhelmingly chose early university entrance because they were excited to learn; many also praised the peer group, intellectual stimulation, and faculty and staff support. Some reported feeling too young to make important academic, career, and social decisions, with more males regretting the lack of dating partners because of age differences. As the program has matured, so have students' positive experiences in it. Significant differences were found among three groups of students who entered at different points, reflecting this maturation. A wealth of open-ended comments indicated that the program continues to exert a profound and positive influence on graduates' lives."

The present study sought to add to the knowledge base on this issue by investigating the occurrence of underachievement behaviors and their predictors in a population of highly gifted students attending a summer educational program based on the talent search model. A group of 440 students in Grades 8-10 were given the School Attitude Assessment Survey-Revised at the beginning of the program. Attitudes toward and grades obtained in students' regular schools had little to no predictive value on students' academic and behavioral performance during the summer program. Results support qualitative findings in the literature, suggesting that educational interventions can be extremely effective in reversing the expression of underachieving behaviors."

Data are collected from a convenience sample of identified gifted students (N = 143) and their parents (N = 161) using a Likert-type questionnaire, the Overexcitabilities Questionnaire 11, developed to measure levels of the five intensities of the OEs. Multivariate and univariate analyses of variance and hierarchical linear modeling are used to differentiate between gender and age groups and to explain between- and within-group variance on the five subscales of the OEs: Psychomotor, Intellectual, Imaginational, Sensual, and Emotional. Results suggest that there were significant differences between gender and age groups and that most of the variance among students on the OEs was explained by family membership. This study represents an important step in our understanding of affective characteristics of giftedness and creativity."

The contributions of these variables to self-esteem and academic achievement are also examined. Results indicate the ethnic minority groups had significantly higher El scores than their White counterparts but do not differ on OGO. El predicts self-esteem for the Hispanic students, and OGO predicts self-esteem for the African American students, but neither variable predicts selfesteem for the other two groups. El and OGO are negative and positive predictors of school achievement, respectively, but only for African American students, and neither variable predicts achievement in a summer program for academically talented youth.

The Gifted Rating Scales-School Form (GRS-S) is based on a multidimensional model of giftedness. Results indicate no age or race/ethnicity differences on any of the scales and small but significant differences in favor of females on three of the six scales: Artistic Ability, Motivation, and Leadership Ability. Diagnostic efficiency statistics and receiver operating curve analysis support the validity of the Intellectual Ability scale in identifying intellectually gifted students. The Intellectual Ability scale was successful in both correctly identifying students with high IQ scores (test sensitivity) and correctly identifying students without high IQ scores (test specificity). The present findings extend the analysis of the standardization sample reported in the test manual and provide additional support for the psychometric qualities of the GRS-S as a valid gifted screening tool."

The study employs a Self-Confidence Attitude Attribute Scale questionnaire, which measures ability and effort attributions. Participants are three groups of highly, moderately, or mildly mathematically gifted Finnish adolescents and adults (N = 203). The results of Bayesian classification modeling show that items attributing success to effort and failure to lack of effort are the best predictors for the level of mild mathematical giftedness and gender (females). The results of multivariate analysis of variance show that highly and moderately mathematically gifted students reported that ability was more important for success than effort, but mildly mathematically. gifted tended to see effort as leading to success. Moderately and mildly mathematically gifted students attribute failure to lack of effort, whereas highly mathematically gifted students attribute failure to lack of ability."

360,2006.0,Attributional choices for academic success and failure by intellectually gifted students,"Attributional choices for academic success and failure by intellectually gifted students   This study emerges from the lack of empirical research on the gifted students' attributions about acedemic success and failure in multiple subject areas and school in general. We explore differences in top attributional choices between boys and girls for success and failure in general acedemic, language arts, science, and mathematics. Gifted students were more likely to attribute failure to not working hard enough (long-term effort), rather than to not being smart (ability). Sex differences were found in attributional choices for genmeral academics, science, mathematics, and language arts. The findings counter some popular theoretica expectations of gifted students' attributional choicescfor success and failure in their acdemic performance."
361,2006.0,Suicide ideation and personality characteristics among gifted adolescents,"Suicide ideation and personality characteristics among gifted adolescents   This study describes psychological characteristics of gifted adolescents. It also identifies the relationships between psychological personality types and suicide ideation. Participation in the study were 152 juniors enrolled in a public residential high school for academically gifted students. The Suicides Ideation Questionnaire, a 30-item self-report measure, was use to assess adolescent levels of suicide ideation. The Myers-Type Indicator (MBTI; Myers, 1962), a widely used measure of psychological type that contrasts four dimensions of personality - extraversion (E)/introversion (I), sensing (S)/intuition (N), thinking (T)/feeling (F), and judging (J)/perceiving (P) - was used to determine personality types of the students. The results indicated that gifted adolescents did not exhibit heightened rates of suicide ideation compared to their nongifted peers. However, female students held higher levels of suicide ideation than male students. Female students exhibiting introversion-perceiving (IP) types held higher levels of suicide ideation than those with other types. There was a significant between-groups effect for judging-perceiving analysis. Students identified as perceiving personality types held higher levels of suicide ideation than those with the judging personality type. Gender, judging/perceiving, and extraversion/introversion combined to reliably predict approximately 18% of the variance in suicide ideation in this sample."
362,2006.0,Insights from SMPY's greatest former child prodigies: Drs. Terence (Terry) Tao and Lenhard (Lenny) Ng reflect on their talent development,"Insights from SMPY's greatest former child prodigies: Drs. Terence (Terry) Tao and Lenhard (Lenny) Ng reflect on their talent development   If the academic needs of the most profoundly gifted students can be met through the use of existing education practices, specialists in gifted education can assume that the educational needs of less able, but still academically talented, students can also be met by using some combination of these strategies as well. This paper illustrates the feasability and effectiveness of utilizing an individualized educational approach with gifted students by highlighting the unique educational paths taken by two of the very ablest math prodigies identified by Dr. Julian Stanley through the Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth (SMPY) since its founding in 1971. Interviews with Dr. Terence (Terry) Tao and Dr. Lenhard (Lenny) Ng, now both highly successful mathematicians, are presented in their entirety, demonstrating that even among the very ablest, strategies can be tailored effectively to the characterisitics of each student can be tailored effectively to the characteristics of each student through a combination of creative planning and the cooperation of parents, educators, and mentors."
363,2006.0,Perceived multiple intelligences among male and female Chinese gifted students in Hong Kong: The structure of the student multiple intelligences profile,"Perceived multiple intelligences among male and female Chinese gifted students in Hong Kong: The structure of the student multiple intelligences profile   This study examined the structure of perceived multiple intelligences of 1.464 Chinese gifted students using the Student Multiple Intelligence Profile. To evaluate whether perceived multiple intelligences could be applied adequately across boys and girls, a model hypothesizing different degrees of equivalence across the two gender groups was tested using multigroup confirmatory factor analysis. The results indicated that the structure of perceived multiple intelligences, which included the number and nature of dimensions, as well as the structural relationships among the 8 intelligences assessed, was largely similar for boys and girls. Subsequent second-order confirmatory factor analyses separately conducted for boys and girls suggested that both boys and girls might perceive the 8 intelligences or one of the nonpersonal intelligences. Implications of the findings including subtle differences in the perceived strengths on the 8 individual subtle differences in the perceived strengths on the 8 individual intelligences by boys and girls are discussed."

370,2006.0,A content analysis of evaluation findings across 20 gifted programs: A clarion call for enhanced gifted program development,"A content analysis of evaluation findings across 20 gifted programs: A clarion call for enhanced gifted program development   This article delineates the results of 7 gifted program evaluation studies conducted in 20 different school districts and places them in the context of major areas for gifted program improvement. The author suggests that the field of gifted education may be vulnerable to losing its infrastructure at local levels if enhanced program development in key areas does not occur over the next few years and if the studied districts are at all similar to the larger group. The paper discusses key areas of program development including identification, curriculum, program design, staff development, parental involvement assessment, and evaluation. The author contends that attention to these areas is essential for improving gifted program quality and stabilizing programs."
371,2006.0,A study of instructional methods used in fast-paced classes,"A study of instructional methods used in fast-paced classes   This study involved 15 secondary-level teachers who taught fast-paced classes at a university-based program and similar regularly paced their local schools in order to examine classes in how teachers differentiate or modify instructional methods and content selections for fast-paced classes. Interviews were conducted with the teachers during the summer sessions with a brief survey used as supplemental data. Overall, teachers in this study used a varied set of instructional strategies and in-class activities for their fast-paced classes including lectures, presentations, group activities, demonstrations, frequent tests and quizzes, timed writing, essays, and discussion. The shorter time frame (3 weeks versus 9 months) and teachers' perceptions about students' academic abilities were the two major reasons given for the differentiated instructional strategies and content in the fast-paced classes. In the survey data, less repetition in course content, advanced-level readings and questions, and more independence in learning were found for the fast-paced classes. Yet, the teachers were not likely to move beyond the textbook for enrichment materials or individualize homework or assignments for students in their fast-paced classes. They also expressed concerns regarding depth versus breadth of the material covered in the 3-week courses."
372,2006.0,Perfectionism in high-ability students: Relational precursors and influences on achievement motivation,"Perfectionism in high-ability students: Relational precursors and influences on achievement motivation   The purpose of the present study was to create and test a model that (a) illustrated variables influencing the development of perfectionism, and (b) demonstrated how different types of perfectionism may influence the achievement goals of high-ability students. Using, a multiple-groups path analysis, the researchers found that parenting style was related to attachment, with authoritative and permissive parenting associated with secure attachment and authoritarian and uninvolved parenting associated with insecure attachment. Attachment, in turn, was related to perfectionism, with insecure attachment associated with either self-oriented or socially prescribed perfectionism. In addition, the model then illustrated that perfectionism would influence achievement goals, with self-oriented perfectionists more likely to set mastery or performance-approach goals, and socially prescribed perfectionists more likely to set performance-approach or performance-avoidance goals. The findings of this study are interpreted in the context of the existing literature, and implications for working with high-ability perfectionistic students are discussed."
373,2006.0,Bullying among the gifted: The subjective experience,"Bullying among the gifted: The subjective experience   One portion of a national study of bullying, which surveyed gifted 8th graders regarding bullying during their school years (N = 432), used structured interviews (N = 57) to explore the lived experience of being bullied or being a bully. Qualitative analysis of interview data found that even just one incident was highly distressing for some. Also important are the findings that many victims suffered in silence, struggled to understand bullying, assumed responsibility for stopping it themselves, despaired when it continues, and thought violent thoughts. Intelligence appeared to have helped most of those interviewed of bullying, including those who had intentionally halted their own bullying. Many subjects believed that not being known contributed to being bullied. Helping students to make social connections and adjustments, especially during the early middle school years, may be crucial to their wellbeing and to their feeling safe in school."

The questionnaires focused on three domains of instructional practices: cognitive, interpersonal, and intrapersonal. First, an initial questionnaire was developed for a pilot study, and data were gathered to analyze questionnaire items with 97 general education teachers. Second, the questionnaire was revised based on the findings of the first-phase data analysis. Third, the revised questionnaire was distributed to two new samples (144 general education teachers I and 67 GATE resource room teachers) in ail effort to provide reliability and validity evidence of the scores from the revised questionnaire. The questionnaire would be useful for educators and researchers who are interested in understanding instructional prac- tices of classroom teachers and in improving classroom instruction for gifted and talented students."
377,2006.0,The relationship between classroom environment and the learning style preferences of gifted middle school students and the impact on levels of performance,"The relationship between classroom environment and the learning style preferences of gifted middle school students and the impact on levels of performance   Inconsistent performance by gifted students has been a source of frustration for both parents and educators for decades. Several studies on gifted underachievement point to a connection between student learning styles and classroom performance. This study examined the learning styles of gifted middle school students, student perceptions of the classroom environment, and possible connections between learning style, classroom environment, and achievement levels. Eighty gifted students from grades 6, 7, and 8 were administered the Learning Style Inventory (LSI) to identify student learning style preferences. They were also adiministered the Student Perception Inventory (SPI), developed for the study, in order to determine perceptions of these learning style elements in their classroom environments. Results indicated that the LSI elements of persistence and lighting correlated with achievement In all content areas. Additionally, correlations between higher grade point averages (GPA) and LSI preferences for responsibility and teacher motivation were found in science and math classes. Results of the SPI revealed a correlation between higher grade point averages in social studies and science classrooms and the following items: persistence; motivation; and auditory, tactile, and kinesthetic modalities. All subject areas showed a correlation between higher GPA and the students' perceived level of persistence."
378,2006.0,A case study of teachers of gifted learners: Moving from prescribed practice to described practitioners,"A case study of teachers of gifted learners: Moving from prescribed practice to described practitioners   Two exemplary teachers of gifted learners were studied in order to get a better understanding of both teacher practices and teacher thoughts about those practices. Through extensive observation and in-depth interviews, these teachers demonstrated and discussed the qualities they felt to be essential for educating gifted learners. Though each teacher leads a different kind of classroom experience, both assert that (a) teaching gifted learners requires the framing of individualized and whole-group learning simultaneously, and (b) that the path a person takes to become a teacher of gifted learners is important. Equally significant is the way each of these teachers assimilates and combines some of the canonical ideas of gifted education. This kind of study is rare in our literature, but may be invaluable for teachers-pre-service teachers or those already working-who want to hone their skills in working with gifted learners."
379,2006.0,Five readers browsing: The reading interests of talented middle school boys,"Five readers browsing: The reading interests of talented middle school boys   Researchers concerned with curriculum differentiation for gifted and talented students have long promoted the benefits of providing opportunities for students to explore their personal interests within the regular curriculum. Many literacy researchers have also concluded that teachers can improve students' (especially boys') attitudes toward reading by offering opportunities within the literacy curriculum for students to choose reading materials based on their own personal interests. However, there are few empirical investigations into the particular interests of talented boy readers to guide teachers who wish to provide students with a rich selection of texts from which to choose. In this multicase study, 5 boys who are talented readers were observed while they browsed for reading materials in a large bookstore. Interviews with each boy and analysis of the texts that they identified as personally interesting revealed 4 major themes that together characterize the complexity of these boys' reading preferences."
380,2006.0,"Bullying and the gifted: Victims, perpetrators, prevalence, and effects","Bullying and the gifted: Victims, perpetrators, prevalence, and effects   Gifted eighth graders (N = 432) in 11 U.S. states participated in a retrospective national study that explored the prevalence and effects of being bullied and being a bully during kindergarten through grade 8. No significant differences were found related to size of city, race/ethnicity, and geographical region in terms of either being bullied or being a bully. Sixty-seven percent of all participants had experienced at least 1 of 13 kinds of bullying listed on the survey, more in grade 6 than in other grades, and 11 % had experienced repeated bullying. Name-calling and teasing about appearance were the most common kinds of bullying, and the latter was among several kinds of bullying significantly related to emotional impact. In grade 8, 16% were bullies, and 29% had violent thoughts. At all grade levels, a larger percentage of males than females were bullied, were bullied more than 10 times, and were bullies."
381,2006.0,A study of well-being and school satisfaction among academically talented students attending a science high school in Korea,"A study of well-being and school satisfaction among academically talented students attending a science high school in Korea   The purpose of this study was to examine whether academically talented adolescents attending a residential science high school in Korea had different levels of psychological well-being or school life satisfaction than their high-ability peers in regular high schools. The participating high-ability students (n = 299) were in their second year of high school and were attending either a science high school (n = 111) or a regular high school (n = 188) in the same province in Korea. Both groups completed the Psychological Well Being scales (Ryff, 1989a) and a researcher-constructed Satisfaction With School Life scale. In addition, the science high school students responded to open-ended questions about their experiences in the science high school. No statistically significant differences were found in psychological well-being, but there were statistically significant differences in school life satisfaction favoring the science high school group. The responses of the science high school sample to the open-ended questions indicated that they appreciated the advanced curriculum and the expertise of their teachers. They also reported satisfactory relationships with teachers and peers. Overall, the study suggested that the residential science high school was meeting the educational needs of these talented. Korean, students, at least better than traditional high. schools. However, this study could not confirm. its primary expectation that the specialized schooling for gifted students would enhance psychological well-being. Implications of the study for research and practice are discussed."

It was hypothesized that this population of very intelligent children would demonstrate much larger Verbal-Performance discrepancies than are reported in the WISC-III manual. The hypothesis was confirmed, and a table reporting Verbal-Performance discrepancies established that very large discrepancies are typical for this population. The implications of these results are discussed, as well as the limitations of the study, particularly as it pertains to the limitations of the sample."

Teachers implemented the William and Mary units and several of the teaching models used in the units with all students. Goals included (a) improved performance of low-, average-, and high-achieving students in mathematics, science, and language arts; and (b) identification of more low-income gifted students. The article reports on the nature of the project, its implementation, and the results that point to changes in teachers' perceptions of students' abilities and of improved student achievement."
386,2006.0,Gifted university males in a Greek fraternity: Creating a culture of achievement,"Gifted university males in a Greek fraternity: Creating a culture of achievement   The gifted education community has called for more research examining gifted students during their collegiate experience. The study described in this article examined gifted university males involved in a Greek fraternity. Through a qualitative case study research design, the investigation examined the collegiate careers of 5 gifted, high-achieving university males to understand how their fraternity experience influenced their achievement. Major findings uncovered in chronicling the university careers of the 5 gifted males included the following: focusing on athletics rather than academics during high school, recruitment to the fraternity as high potential contributors, the fraternity as a bridge to student leadership on campus, and the benefits of a culture of well-rounded achievers striving for self-improvement. Implications of the findings are presented, as are suggestions for meeting the educational needs of gifted males in university settings."

388,2006.0,Counseling needs of gifted students: An analysis of intake forms at a university-based counseling center,"Counseling needs of gifted students: An analysis of intake forms at a university-based counseling center   The purpose of this study was to investigate perceptions of the counseling needs of gifted children from the perspective of parents who sought help from a fee-based counseling center for gifted students. The counseling center provided assessment and educational and career guidance, as well as family social/emotional counseling, all of which were differentiated to meet the needs of gifted children ages 4-18. Participating parents completed intake forms that included a 47-item client problem inventory and were designed to assist the counseling process. One hundred and twenty of these problem inventories were analyzed to determine which counseling needs led parents to bring their children for counseling services and whether there were any differences in perceived needs among three different developmental levels of children (preschool, preadolescent, and adolescent). Results suggested that age had a statistically and practically significant effect on parent perceptions of career and child (psychosocial) concerns and a practically significant effect on school, family, and peer concerns. For all age groups, parents perceived their child's greatest counseling need to be educational planning, followed closely by school concerns. Psychosocial concerns were also salient for parents of children older than 6. Career planning was important for parents of children older than 12. Peer and family concerns were less salient than the other categories of concern. The study suggests that gifted children do have unique needs for differentiated counseling services and that counseling services for gifted children should emphasize educational planning and be targeted to the needs of specific developmental levels."
389,2006.0,A microgenetic analysis of strategic variability in gifted and average-ability children,"A microgenetic analysis of strategic variability in gifted and average-ability children   Many researchers have described cognitive differences between gifted and average-performing children. Regarding strategy use, the gifted advantage is often associated with differences such as greater knowledge of strategies, quicker problem solving, and the ability to use strategies more appropriately. The current study used microgenetic methods from developmental psychology to investigate strategic thinking in gifted children from the perspective of one of the newer models of strategic development, Siegler's (1996) adaptive strategy-choice model. Fifty 2nd-grade children, approximately half of which were identified as intellectually gifted and half of which were average-performing students, were videotaped while playing a computer strategy game. Gifted and average-ability children differed greatly in their patterns of strategy development and use. The implications of these findings on theory and practice are considered."

393,2005.0,Outcomes to creativity training programs,"Outcomes to creativity training programs   How much confidence, based on recent research evidence, can educators have in using creativity training programs in their classrooms? In general, little research has been done since the significant reviews conducted 5 years ago, and much of the research is inaccessible to teachers. Research continues to focus primarily on using strategies in classrooms. Some research is beginning to look at aspects of the creative person, product, and environment, but more could be done to look at the interactions among these. The continued emphasis on classroom strategies raises concerns about the failure by researchers to address issues of strategy transfer to other environments."

With respect to personality research, over the past 50-plus years, many studies have examined characteristics, attitudes, preferences, styles, and other personal qualities that appear to distinguish highly creative individuals. The purposes of this article are to review the accumulated body of creative personality research; describe the works of a few major researchers and their methods; briefly review theories that have been offered to explain why these personal qualities are causes, correlates, and/or outcomes of the creative process; and examine the relatively new construct of creative and problem-solving styles.

Many empirical studies have been conducted regarding the effectiveness of brainstorming, and they have provided useful insights into the salient barriers facing groups who use this tool. Although a great deal of this literature focuses on the limitations of brainstorming, the exploratory study included in this article sheds light on approaches that can enhance the value of this tool by examining the impact of the facilitator's role within group idea generation.

The CPS framework is widely known and applied as one important goal in contemporary gifted education, as well as in relation to initiatives for teaching thinking in the broader context of general education. This article traces the history and evolution of the CPS framework through more than five decades of research, development, and practical application. We describe and discuss the specific changes in the model over time, as well as their rationale and foundations. We discuss the implications of changes within the CPS framework for teaching and learning; our purpose is not to compare or contrast CPS with other perspectives on creativity from psychology, cognitive science, or management. Finally, we present implications of contemporary CPS for instruction and assessment in gifted education."

The participants were tracked in the public school database. Based on the children's first-grade educational status, 2 groups were formed: one consisting of children who were in regular education and the other composed of children who were in the gifted/talented program. The children's preschool screening scores, summed over both the identification-tasks subset and the generating-tasks subset, enabled the identification of high-performing outliers from the regular education sample who performed very well compared to the school-identified gifted sample. However, a majority of minority students among the high-performing outliers were only identified with the generating measure. The superior first-grade achievement performance of 5 of these 7 and the finding that 3 of the 7 had been placed in the gifted program in second grade, attested to the effectiveness of this measure for identifying cognitively gifted minority preschoolers."
403,2005.0,Family environment and talent development of Chinese gifted students in Hong Kong,"Family environment and talent development of Chinese gifted students in Hong Kong   This study assessed the self-perceptions of 432 gifted students regarding their family environments and their talent areas. Family environmental variables included parental expectations to achieve, parents' encouragement to be independent, and family cohesion. Talent areas included academic skills, creativity, and leadership. The conjectures that academic achievement could be enhanced by parental expectations, as well as family cohesion, and that creativity could be enhanced by encouragement to be independent were not fully supported by the regression analyses. However, family environmental variables did predict students' perceived talent areas, especially in leadership, and family cohesion was the consistent significant predictor. Implications of the findings are discussed with reference to cross-cultural research, but caution needs to be exercised in the interpretation of these results, as data were collected only on student perceptions."
404,2005.0,A dynamic scaffolding model of teacher development: The gifted education consultant as catalyst for change,"A dynamic scaffolding model of teacher development: The gifted education consultant as catalyst for change   The Dynamic Scaffolding Model (DSM) of teacher development is proposed as a good way to meet gifted learners' exceptional learning needs while remaining consistent with current educational realities and research. Using an implementation experience as an illustration, we examine how a gifted education consultant can support teachers in addressing the diverse educational needs of high-ability learners in their classrooms, as well as encouraging high-level outcomes in learners not identified as gifted, leading to classrooms that are more engaging for both students and teachers. In this model, teachers are given opportunities for scaffolded learning and interaction in the form of (a) a series of optional professional development workshops on giftedness, (b) ongoing and targeted individual consultation opportunities, and (c) diverse professional liaisons. We compare the DSM with other resource consultation models, and we discuss characteristics identified by participating teachers as important in their work with gifted learners and others."
405,2005.0,Factors that contribute to talented performance: A theoretical model from a Chinese perspective,"Factors that contribute to talented performance: A theoretical model from a Chinese perspective   This paper examines the Chinese literature on giftedness and talented performance (TP) and compares its dominant theoretical features with some influential models to be found in the North American literature. One significant feature to emerge from the Chinese literature is a deemphasis on giftedness as an innate ability and an emphasis on the concept of talented performance. Such a finding is congruent with a Confucian cultural outlook that encourages effort, rather than the identification of giftedness. In order to test this finding against the perceptions of Chinese educators, a preliminary study was carried out involving 14 secondary school teachers. The results confirmed the findings from the literature survey, suggesting that these teachers' perceptions conformed to a model of TP with a developmental conception as its central organizing feature. It is hoped that the implications of this study will contribute to the practice of gifted and talented education in China and will also provide basic theoretical grounds for further research."
406,2005.0,An evaluation of the elementary student talent search by families and schools,"An evaluation of the elementary student talent search by families and schools   Talent searches for seventh and eighth graders have extensive empirical support, and the model has been successfully extended to elementary students. Research has focused on participants earning high scores on above-level tests, however, not typical participants. Here, 597 families and 93 schools that participated in the Carnegie Mellon Institute for Talented Elementary Students (C-MITES) Elementary Student Talent Search (ESTS) completed follow-up surveys designed to measure the typical participant's satisfaction with the program and use of test scores. Families were very satisfied with their ESTS experience, but above-level test scores were not often used by schools. The most corm-non use of the scores was to qualify students for extracurricular programs. School personnel appear to lack understanding of the information to be gained from above-level test scores despite literature provided to them by the talent searches. Talent search organizations need to find creative ways of educating schools about their services so that benefits to all participants can be maximized."
407,2005.0,Do gifted student writers and creative writing experts rate creativity the same way?,"Do gifted student writers and creative writing experts rate creativity the same way?   Little research has been conducted on how gifted novices compare to experts in their judgments of creative writing. If novices and experts assign similar ratings, it could be argued that gifted novices are able to offer their peers feedback of a similar quality to that provided by experts. Such a finding would support the use of collaborative feedback in gifted classrooms. We asked gifted high school creative writers and three groups of experts (cognitive psychologists, creative writers, and teachers) to rate a set of 27 short stories and 28 poems for creativity using a scale of 1 to 6. The interrater agreement among the novices was within acceptable standards, and the agreement among the experts was very strong. When the ratings of novices were compared to the ratings of experts, a strong degree of correlation was found, supporting the use of peer feedback among gifted novice creative writers."

411,2005.0,The important role of optimism in a motivational investigation of the education of gifted adolescents,"The important role of optimism in a motivational investigation of the education of gifted adolescents   Intellectually gifted 7(th)-grade students were surveyed approximately halfway through their 1(st) year of high school in order to investigate relationships between motivational and affective variables, commitment to schoolwork, and satisfaction with school. The results of the confirmatory factor analyses and structural equation modeling suggest that relationships of mediatng variables such as optimism, strain on coping resources, extrinsic motivation, and intrinsic motivation with satisfaction with school and commitment to schoolwork should be considered in the context of the motivational needs of gifted students."
412,2005.0,The role of nonverbal ability tests in identifying academically gifted students: An aptitude perspective,"The role of nonverbal ability tests in identifying academically gifted students: An aptitude perspective   The first goal of,this article is to discuss the role-of nonverbal ability tests in the identification of academically gifted children. I note that most nonverbal tests measure verbally mediated cognitive processes, that they are neither culture free nor culture fair, and that we have known these facts for a very long time. I show that selecting students for gifted and talented programs on the basis of such tests would exclude, the majority of the most academically accomplished students in all ethnic groups. The second goal is to propose abetter method for identifying gifted students. I argue that the critical issue is readiness for a particular type of educational opportunity. The cognitive aspects of readiness are evidence first in students levels of knowledge and skill in particular. domains and secondarily in their abilities to reason in the symbol systems used to communicate new knowledge in these domains. This applies to both, minority and majority students. Therefore, the most, academically talented minority students are those who show the strongest current achievement in particular domains and the best ability to reason in the symbol systems required for the acquisition of new knowledge in those domains. I also argue that, although current accomplishment can be measured on a common scale, judgments about potential must always be made relative to circumstances."
413,2005.0,From noncompetance of exceptional talent: Exploring the range of academic achievement within and between grade levels,"From noncompetance of exceptional talent: Exploring the range of academic achievement within and between grade levels   This article analyzes the magnitude of individual differences in: academic achievement and their growth over the first 9 years of schooling. The author anchors the widening-gap phenomenon on the theoretical recognition of large individual differences in learning pace, which logically leads over time to an increasing gap in, knowledge and skills between the fastest and slowest learners. The achievement data used as evidence were borrowed from the developmental standard score (SS) norms of the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills (ITBS; Hoover, Dunbar, & Frisbie, 2001). These norms reveal, among other things, that within most grade, levels the range between the lowest and highest achievers exceeds the 8-year gap in knowledge between average 1st- and 9th-grade students. Moreover, the achievement gap widens by about 145% between: grades 1 and 9. Parallel evidence suggests that standardized achievement test data probably underestimate the true differences. Because it ensues from stable individual differences in learning aptitude, educators should not perceive that widening achievement gap as a failure of the educational system, but should recognize it instead as a proof that all learners are given the opportunity to progress'. at, their own learning pace."
414,2005.0,Radical acceleration and early entry to college: A review of the research,"Radical acceleration and early entry to college: A review of the research   Radical acceleration is a successful, yet rarely utilized educational practice that assists educators in meeting the cognitive and affective needs of highly gifted students. Individual case studies and cohort studies of students who have radically accelerated are reviewed regarding combinations of procedures that result in successful acceleration, variables that appear to predict success and cognitive and affective outcomes. While research supports the use of radical acceleration for the positive cognitive and affective gains that result for highly gifted students some concerns about the process have been identified. An outline is presented of procedures that have been shown to lessen the likelihood of unfavourable outcomes. These procedures include counseling support, study skills programs, and opportunities to foster social interaction with other students. The literature concerning radical acceleration strongly supports the wider adoption of this most successful intervention."
415,2005.0,Educational characteristics of adolescents with gifted academic intrinsic motivation: A longitudinal investigation from school entry through early adulthood,"Educational characteristics of adolescents with gifted academic intrinsic motivation: A longitudinal investigation from school entry through early adulthood   The construct of gifted motivation was examined in a contemporary, long-term, longitudinal investigation. Adolescents with extremely high academic intrinsic motivation (i.e., gifted motivation) were compared to their cohort peer comparison on a variety of educationally relevant measures from elementary school through the early adulthood years. Assessment of academic intrinsic motivation was based on the Children's Academic Intrinsic Motivation Inventory. Cross-time, pervasive differences resulted favoring the gifted motivation compared to the cohort comparison group on motivation, achievement, classroom functioning, intellectual performance, self-concept, and postsecondary education talk progress. Meaningful effect sizes were obtained and corroborated by teachers' observations. Gifted motivation proved to be distinct from gifted intelligence. This research serves to expand the definition of giftedness to include the construct of gifted motivation in its own right. These findings have implications for identifying students with gifted motivation for entry into programs for the gifted."

In the present study, the development of the symptoms of learned helplessness was of particular interest. A study involving average and mildly gifted 8th-grade boys and girls (top 6%) investigated whether girls, regardless of ability level, experience helplessness in introductory physics courses more intensely than their male counterparts. Contrary to current research findings, no particular disadvantages for gifted girls could be isolated. In total, 7 explanatory approaches to helplessness were examined by regression analysis: the talent deficit hypothesis, the prior physics knowledge deficit hypothesis, the self-confidence deficit hypothesis, the modification deficit hypothesis, the interest deficit hypothesis, the anxiety hypothesis, and the control deficit hypothesis. On the basis of these findings, approaches to assist in the development of interventions are suggested."

In a recent article in this journal, Naglieri and Ford (2003) claimed that Black and Hispanic students are as likely to earn high scores on the Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test (NNAT; Naglieri, 1997a) as White students. However, the sample that Naglieri and Ford used was not representative of the U.S. school population as a whole and was quite unrepresentative of ethnic subgroups within that population. For example, only 5.6% of the children in their sample were from urban school districts, and both Black and Hispanic students were relatively more likely to be from high socioeconomic status (SES) families than were White families. Further, the mean and standard deviation in the sample differed significantly from the NNAT fall test norms, which were based on the same data. Finally, White-Black and White-Hispanic differences reported by Naglieri and Ford were smaller than those reported by Naglieri and Ronning (2000a) in a previous analysis of the same data set in which students were first matched on several demographic variables. For these reasons, I argue that the authors' claims not supported by the data they present."
419,2005.0,Increasing minority children's participation in gifted classes using the NNAT: A response to Lohman,"Increasing minority children's participation in gifted classes using the NNAT: A response to Lohman   In a previous article, we (Naglieri & Ford, 2003) provided evidence from a large-scale study that similar proportions of White, Black, and Hispanic children would be identified as gifted using the Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test (NNAT; Naglieri, 1997). Lohman (2005) has taken issue with our conclusions and our methods. We provide several responses to his arguments and make five important points. First, we take the position that underrepresentation of minority children in classes for the gifted is a serious problem that must be remedied. Second, traditional measures of ability that include verbal and quantitative tests pose particular problems to less-advantaged children who may be intelligent, but lack verbal and math knowledge. Third, we argue that the CogAT verbal and quantitative tests of ability correlate higher with the ITBS achievement tests than the CogAT nonverbal tests of ability because of the similarity of skills needed to answer the items on both the ITBS and the CogAT. Fourth, we reject an emphasis on academically gifted children that excludes the identification of intellectually gifted children who happen to have poor academic skills. Fifth, we request that critics of the NNAT provide evidence of the magnitude of race and ethnic differences, as well as the likely effect on representation of minorities using whatever alternative they propose."
420,2005.0,Investigation of high school credit and placement for summer coursework taken outside of local schools,"Investigation of high school credit and placement for summer coursework taken outside of local schools   This study examined how local schools responded to students' outside-of-school summer courses, particularly regarding the awarding of credit and appropriate placement. It involved 262 middle and high school administrators of students who had attended a gifted summer program at a local university. Survey data showed the critical influence of the school's policies on granting credit for outside-of-school coursework and institutional accreditation on the school's responses. For high schools, territory or administrative issues such as the school's own policy on credit, prior notice of a student's participation in the program, sharing outside-of-school course syllabi with school officials in advance, the type of course, and accreditation of the summer program were crucial in decisions regarding the awarding of credit. For middle schools, the school's own evaluation of a student's mastery of the course content, prior notice of the student's participation in the program, and the student's performance in the outside-of-school course were the most significant factors that affected schools' responses regarding appropriate placement. Findings showed that schools' responses were conservative and that parents need to petition more actively for credit or placement for their children."
421,2005.0,Recruitment is not enough: Retaining African American students in gifted education,"Recruitment is not enough: Retaining African American students in gifted education   In public school systems all around the country, educators-teachers, counselors, and administrators- have made significant progress in identifying and recruiting diverse populations in gifted and enrichment programs. Despite the efforts, too many African American students and other students of color (e.g., Hispanic Americans and Native Americans) are not faring well in gifted education. The social and cultural obstacles (e.g., racial and ethnic prejudice, negative peer pressure, poor parental involvement, negative teacher and counselor expectations, etc.) that students of color, particularly African Americans, face in gifted education are well known. In order to improve African American student retention, it is clear that public school systems must do more. Recruitment is an important component for increasing the number of African American students in gifted education, but retention is equally important. Using multiple frameworks, this article examines the notion of retention and its many challenges and offers recommendations for improving the retention of African American students in gifted education."

Respondents indicated the degree to which they agreed or disagreed with 20 items that reflected guidelines for a comprehensive identification system. Five factors were derived from 20 items. Respondents favored the use of individual expression criteria, ongoing assessment, multiple criteria for identification, and consideration of contextual factors. Teachers of the gifted and respondents from urban areas were more likely to favor these strategies. The sample opposed restricting identification to the sole use of achievement or IQ scores."

Employing a qualitative interview design, this study examined factors comntributing to the development of two dimensions of perfectionism, socially prescribed and self-orientated, in gifted college students. Findings indicated that exposure to parental perfectionism and an authoritarian parenting style led to the perception of stringent expectations, self-worth tied to achievement, and a fear of disappointing others, which collectively influenced the development of socially prescribed perfectionism. Factors contributing to the development of self-oriented perfection included mastery of early academic experiences without effort, no previous experience with academic failure, and modeling of parental perfectionism. Implications for future research and recommendations for parents and educators of gifted children are suggested."
426,2004.0,Parenting styles and mental health of Arab gifted adolescents,"Parenting styles and mental health of Arab gifted adolescents   This study examined the parental styles and psychosocial adjustment of adolescents and the relationship between them in gifted as compared to non-gifted Arab adolescents. Five scales-The parental Authority Questionnaire. Child Attitude Toward Parents, Lipsitt's Self-Concept Scale for Children, Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale, and the Psychological State Scale-were administered to 118 gifted and 115 nongifted Arab adolescents in Isreal. Results indicate that parents of gifted adolescents tend to be more authoritarive and less authoritarian then parents of nongifted adolescents. The attitudes of the gifted adolescents their parents were more positive than those of the nongifted adolescents. The gifted displayed higher self-esteem and fewer identity disorders, phobias, and conduct disorders than the nongifted adolescents. The authoritative parental style correlates positively with the mental health of both gifted and nongifted adolescents, while the authoritarian parenting impacts negatively on the mental health of the gifted, but not of the nongifted adolescents. The study results indicate that the authoritarian parenting style is a crucial factor that influences the well-being of gifted children and may affect their psychological adjustment. More studies are needed among gifted underachievers and among eminent Arab writers and artists."

The LBS is a 29-item rating scale assessing learning behaviours related to academic success. Cohort 1 consisted of 387 students and cohort 2 consisted 287 students. The AT students , scores were similar to scores of gifted and talented and high-IQ students in the normative sample, and reliability estimates of participants' scores were in the moderate to high range. The scores resulted in factors that were similar to those found in the normative sample. and coefficients of congruence were greater than .85 for two LBS factors across samples. LBS scores predicted achievement after controlling for previous achievement and socioeconomic status. Future research should examine LBS scores in public school settings with identified and referred students."
428,2004.0,The case law on gifted education: A new look,"The case law on gifted education: A new look   To fill a gap in the literature, this article provides a comprehensive, concise, and current overview of the case law-specifically, published hearing/review officer and court decisions-concerning gifted education for K-12 students. This case law represents two distinct groups: gifted-alone, designating students whose legal status is based solely on their gifted status, and gifted plus, designating students who not only are gifted, but also have special legal status typically in terms of disability (i.e., twice exceptional'') or race. The outcomes of the case law in both categories have generally favored the defendant school districts. The abscence in many states of strong and specific legislation or regulations for gifted-alone students and the lack of judicial sensitivity to the complexity of the gifted-plus category likely contribute to the overall district-friendly trend of the case law to date."
429,2004.0,Reading instruction for talented readers: Case studies documenting few opportunities for continuous progress,"Reading instruction for talented readers: Case studies documenting few opportunities for continuous progress   In this study, a team of researchers conducted multiple observations in 12 third-and seventh grade reading classrooms in both urban and suburban school districts over a 9-month period. These observations focused on whether talented readers received differentiated reading curriculum and/or instructional strategies. Talented readers were defined as students reading at least two grades above their chronological grade placement who also had advanced language skills and advanced processing capabilities in reading. Results indicated that talented readers received some differentiated reading instruction. Appropriately challenging books were seldom made available for talented students in their classrooms, and they were rarley provided with more challenging work. Different patterns did emerge across districts. For example, the three classroom teachers who did provide some level of differentiation all taught in suburban schools."

The characteristics, named overexcitables, are described within the context of Dabrowski's Theory of Positive Disintegration. Five scholars of Dabrowski's theory rated an initial 100 items for content validity. The 61 strongest items comprised the pilot instrument, which teachers used to describe 373 students. Exploratory factor analysis using varimax rotation found factors that related to 5 OEs. Items with loadings of less than .5 were eliminated, thus creating the 30-item ElemenOE. Teachers used the ElemenOE to describe 171 gifted and nonidentical children. A discriminant analysis yielded one function that significantly discriminated between groups. The ElemenOE classified 76% of gifted students and 42% of nonidentified students as having similar OE profiles. These results indicate that, with revisions, the elementOE may be useful in identifying gifted students who are missed by traditional identification measures."

The group identified as gifted scored significantly on 3 of 4 socially related self-concept subscales (p < .01) and on the general self-concept scale (p < .05) of the Self-Description Questionnaire-I (March, 1998). On the Student Social Attribution Scale (Bell & McCallum, 1995), an interaction effect was noted, with the group identified as gifted scoring higher than the comparison group on attributions for social success due to ability and effort and lower on attributions for social failure due to ability, effort, and task difficulty. Though teachers' ratings of peer relationships yielded no differences between the 2 groups, boys across groups were rated significantly higher than girls (p < .05)."
433,2004.0,A comparative study of creativity and cognitive problem-solving strategies of high-IQ and average students,"A comparative study of creativity and cognitive problem-solving strategies of high-IQ and average students   This study assessed the creative thinking abilities of high-IQ and average students on fluency, flexibility, originality and elaboration. Seventeen high-IQ fifth and sixth graders and 20 average fifth and sixth graders were given 4 batteries of Torrance's Verbal and Figural Tests (A and B) as pretests and posttests and three Future Problem Solving tasks to assess their creative thinking and problem-solving skills. A significant interaction between performance, and IQ over time was demonstrated for verbal fluency. The high-IQ students scored low and finished higher over time. The average students scored high on the pretest, but dropped over time. The interaction for figural elaboration indicated little difference between the groups at pretest, but there was an increase for the average students, and a decrease for the high-IQ students at posttest. Variability in performances of both high-IQ students and average students suggests the need for training in creative thinking skills."
434,2004.0,Cognitive and motivational characteristics of adolescents gifted in mathematics: Comparisons among students with different types of giftedness,"Cognitive and motivational characteristics of adolescents gifted in mathematics: Comparisons among students with different types of giftedness   Although numerous studies have compared cognitive and motivational characteristics between gifted versus nongifted students, research comparing those characteristics among different types of gifted students has not kept up with the theoretical development that saw a transition from unidimensional to multidimensional conceptualizations of giftedness. This study compares cognitive and motivational characteristics of high school students who are academically gifted in math, creatively talented in math, and nongifted. Whereas no differences between were found among the three groups in their beliefs about ability, most of the other characteristics examined in the study distinguished the three groups. Academically gifted female students reported expending more effort than did academically gifted male students. Creatively talented males put forth more effort than academically gifted males, and the creatively talented in general used more cognitive strategies than the academically gifted. Overall, students who were either academically gifted or creatively talented in mathematics perceived that they were self-efficacious in general, used cognitive strategies, perceived their math ability and math self-efficacy to be high, and valued learning math more so than their nongifted age peers."

The psychometric properties of scores on the TCT-DP were examined on a sample story of 2,368 Hong Kong Chinese students aged 12 to 16. The study compared with TCT-DP's internal consistency, interrater and test-retest reliability coefficients for the Hong Kong sample to previously reported findings for European samples. Structural, concurrent and discriminant validity of the test scores were evaluated. Our data provided encouraging empirical evidence for the reliability and structural discriminant validity of the TCT-DP. The psychometric properties of the test were comparable to those obtained for European samples. However, the sexy low stability of Humor and Unconventionality b scales is of some concern. No sex differences were observed with regard to test scores."
436,2004.0,Understanding the relationship between perfectionism and achievement motivation in gifted college students,"Understanding the relationship between perfectionism and achievement motivation in gifted college students   This study is a slice of an overarching research investigation of perfectionism in gifted college students. Utilizing a qualitative interview design, this study examined how gifted college students scoring high on 1 or 2 different dimensions of perfectionism (socially prescribed or self-oriented) perceived their achievement motivation. Findings indicated that for the socially prescribed perfectionists, an underlying motive to avoid failure influenced their achievement goals and behaviors. Based on this motive, they set both performance avoidance and performance-approach goals and tended toward procrastination in their work. In contrast, an underlying motive to achieve influenced the achievement goals and behaviors of the self-oriented perfectionists. These participants set both mastery and performance approach goals. They developed a strong work ethic, and they were motivated to seek out challenges. Implications of these findings are suggested, and recommendations for parents and educators working with gifted perfectionist students are discussed."
437,2004.0,Multicultural mentoring to increase black male representation in gifted programs,"Multicultural mentoring to increase black male representation in gifted programs   This article explores factors that affect the decision of gifted Black males to participate in gifted programs. Ford (1996) maintains that Black students often choose not to participate in gifted programs, and this choice contributes to their underrepresentation in gifted education. This choice to not participate in gifted programs is often based on social or external influences, particularly negative peer pressures, as well as internal or psychological issues, namely racial identity status. Given this perspective, a participation motivation model, developed by the author, is described along with a discussion of how racial identity influences the choices Black males make about participating in gifted programs. While many options exist for helping these students to make constructive and long-term decisions, this article concentrates on the potentially powerful influence of mentorships as a viable retention strategy."

441,2004.0,An empirical typology of perfectionism in gifted adolescents,"An empirical typology of perfectionism in gifted adolescents   We document a typology of perfectionism in a sample of academically talented adolescents and directly examine its relationship to indices of psychiatric symptomatology, adjustment, self-esteem, and coping. Adolescents enrolled in a state-funded residential academy for academically gifted high school students (N = 141) responded. to the Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale (Frost, Marten, Lahart, & Rosenblate, 1990), the Hopkins Symptom Checklist, the Mastery Coping and Superior Adjustment scales from the Self-Image Questionnaire for Young Adolescents, the Perception of Personal Security and Academic Competence scales from the Self-Esteem Index, and the Coping Inventory (COPE). A 2-step cluster analysis of perfectionism scores revealed four clusters: Mixed-Adaptive (n = 51), Mixed-Maladaptive (n = 20), Pervasive (n = 30), and Self-Assured Nonperfectionist (n = 39). The Pervasive and Mixed-Maladaptive clusters showed a uniformly poor profile of mental health, adjustment, and coping relative to Mixed-Adaptive and Nonperfectionists. The Mixed-Adaptive cluster reported greater academic competence and superior adjustment than did the Nonperfectionist cluster, although these cluster groups were statistically similar on other dimensions of mental health and adjustment. These results suggest that maladaptive perfectionism takes two forms: pervasive and mixed. Implications for intervention and directions for future research are discussed."

This case study is drawn from a wider study of a group of precocious readers, all of whom had received no explicit instruction, but who had had positive literacy experiences in their homes. The subject of this study was able to read fluently at the age of 5 years and 4 months. Her reading was at least 5 years ahead of her chronological age and her spelling was 4 years ahead. Her reading speed was also very proficient. Moreover, tests indicated that her pseudoword reading was highly accurate and that she was highly proficient on a series of measures of phonemic awareness. Her performance was also assessed at the ages of 6, 7, and 11 years. She continued to show high levels of ability in all aspects of literacy. This study contrasts with recent case studies on very precocious readers who showed poor levels of phonological awareness and who were unable to spell at an early age."
443,2004.0,Toward the development of a ceonceptualization of gifted motivation,"Toward the development of a ceonceptualization of gifted motivation   Whereas perspectives on giftedness have included motivation as a construct related to giftedness, the proposed conceptualization advances a new view that motivation is an area of giftedness in and of itself. Academic intrinsic motivation (i.e., enjoyment of school learning) is the domain focused upon in this conceptuahzation inasmuch as it has inherent ties to cognition, gifted intellect, and achievement. Research supports the following criteria, advanced as a beginning effort toward the development of a conceptualization of a gifted motivation construct: (a) significantly higher academic intrinsic motivation is evidenced by intellectually gifted compared to their comparison cohort; (b) academic intrinsic motivation is significantly, positively, and uniquely related to academic achievement above and beyond IQ; (c) academic intrinsic motivation evidences substantial continuity from childhood through adolescence; and (d) environment is significantly related to academic intrinsic motivation. The construct of gifted motivation serves heuristic purposes to advance further inquiry and also has implications regarding the development and implementation of giftedness programs. Suggestions are made regarding research needed for further development of a gifted motivation construct."

The Inventory of Childhood Memories and Imaginings: Children's Form (ICMIC; Myers, 1983) was used to assess fantasy-proneness. IQ scores were generated through the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test (K-BIT; Kaufman & Kaufman, 1990).

Forty-four students in grades 5-11 completed interviews or questionnaires while attending a summer residential program for gifted and talented students. Questions were designed to clarify the nature of academic and social outcomes under the two grouping conditions. On the whole, the participants perceived homogenous grouping more positively with respect to academic outcomes. They learned more in the more challenging environment provided by homogenous classes. However, they had mixed feelings about which setting better met their social needs. Participants seemed to value having both similar peers in homogeneous classes. A troubling finding that emerged was the preference of a few of the students for heterogenous classes because they were easier and enabled them to attain a high class ranking with little work. Implications of the findings for educators and counselors of gifted students are discussed."
449,2004.0,Exploring teacher biases when nominating students for gifted programs,"Exploring teacher biases when nominating students for gifted programs   The purpose of this study was to identify student characteristics that might influence teachers in referring students for gifted programs. We developed a series of 12 student profiles to measure teacher bias and asked teachers to indicate how strongly they believed the students in the profiles should or should not be recommended for their district gifted program. We found the ability to do mental computations over-shadowed completion of schoolwork, and the esoteric nature of student interest appeared to be equivalent to completion of schoolwork. We found that completing schoolwork was not a factor when students possessed a large storehouse of information. We also learned that classroom teachers may be more inclined than gifted specialists to focus on student weaknesses, rather than student strengths."

The findings indicated that gender age, and nonverbal IQ had notable effects on specific social coping strategies. Students' coping by valuing peer acceptance and coping by attempting avoidance emerged as 2 of the most important social coping strategies predicting specific psychological symptoms.

This study investigated 132 Korean preservice and in-service teachers' attitudes on the same measure. Both Korean teacher groups favored athleticism and nonstudiousness over academic brilliance and showed a gender bias by designating their preferred characters as boys more often. The least favored character was the academically brilliant, studious, nonathletic student often considered traditionally gifted and usually designated as a girl. The anti-intellectualism, sport mindedness, and gender bias in the present study's Korean participants was similar to that found in American samples. These results suggest a need for better teacher training and understanding of gifted students. This study is important because it reminds us of future and current teachers' views of gifted students, especially in Korea, where gifted education is now being initiated. Also, it demonstrates the ubiquitous nature of anti-intellectualism, even in a country considered to value academics."
452,2004.0,"We recruit them, but then what? The educational and psychological experiences of academically talented undergraduates","We recruit them, but then what? The educational and psychological experiences of academically talented undergraduates   As universities actively compete for the best and brightest students, educators may wonder about the nature of these,gifted students and what awaits them in college. Yet, research on the programs and opportunities Provided for talented undergraduate's at institutions of higher education is limited, leaving researchers to question what universities are doing for I bright students. The purpose of this review is to examine recent research on academically talented undergraduates, both on the nature of the undergraduates themselves and the programs provided for them at Public institutions of higher education. Areas in need of additional research are discussed."

454,2003.0,Partnerships in science learning: Museum outreach and elementary gifted education,"Partnerships in science learning: Museum outreach and elementary gifted education   The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of a specially designed museum science program on academically gifted elementary students. The program focused on inquiry-based activities that paralleled the work of museum scientists. A pre- and postattitude questionnaire and a parental questionnaire were used to investigate changes in (a) attitude toward science careers, (b) understanding of scientific work and scientists, and (c) content knowledge gains of participant. A version of the Draw-a-Scientist Test (DAST) was incorporated to gauge student perceptions of scientific work. After participation, students indicated a greater understanding of science careers and an increased desire to explore careers in science. Student questionnaire and an illustration analysis identified an increase in participants' content knowledge and understanding of scientific work. Parental questionnaires supported these findings."
455,2003.0,Turning the looking glass inside out: A gifted student in an at-risk setting,"Turning the looking glass inside out: A gifted student in an at-risk setting   This qualitative study occurred in as multigrade classroom of 3rd, 4th and 5th graders in a school labelled at-risk. The focal student in this study was Kirby, identified in this setting as a gifted student. Kirby's classroom teacher and a university researcher collaborated in data collection that included interviews, classroom observations, a teacher journal, artifacts, and analysis over a 3-year period that was centered on literacy learning and teaching. It was discovered that the open-ended, flexible learning and teaching that occurred in the classroom benefited Kirby's learning as well as that of the other children in the classroom. Additionally, Kirby benefited from the rich literacy environment that was established by his mother."
456,2003.0,Characteristics of effective teachers of gifted students: Teacher background and personality styles of students,"Characteristics of effective teachers of gifted students: Teacher background and personality styles of students   This study was designed to explore the characteristics of exceptional teachers of gifted students. Participants included 63 teachers and 1,247 highly able students. Teachers responded to 2 measures: a background questionnaire and the Myers Briggs Type Inventory (MBTI), a self-report personality inventory. Students also completed the MBTI. In response to the background questionnaire, the majority of teachers reported holding advanced degrees in a content area; most were not certified to teach and reported completing no formal coursework in gifted education. Results from the MBTI indicated that exemplary teachers were more likely to prefer N (intuition) and T (thinking), sa compared to a normative teacher sample. The personality types of teachers were in many ways similar to the personality types of the students. These findings suggest that teachers who are judged to be highly effective in working with gifted students prefer abstract themes and concepts, are open and flexible, and value local analysis and objectivity. Results suggest that teacher personality and cognitive style may play a role in his or her effectiveness in teaching gifted students."
457,2003.0,Barriers to aspiration development and self-fulfillment: Interdisciplinary insights for talent discovery,"Barriers to aspiration development and self-fulfillment: Interdisciplinary insights for talent discovery   There is increasing concern about the plight of under-privileged gifted and talented children. Insights from disciplines outside our field can inform educators of the gifted about what hinders talent development among the deprived. A model synthesizing constructs from ethical philosophy, sociology and education reveals socioeconomic barriers to aspiration development, capacity development, and self-fulfillment. Various hypothetical life trajectories on the model illustrate the influences of these barriers on long-range talent development towards self-fulfillment and either egotistic individualism or relational altruism. Implications for gifted education include the need for more ethical awareness in the field and more realistic appraisals of hindrances to aspiration formation among the deprived."

Using a case study design, the author investigates this service learning project grounded in creative problem solving. The importance of service learning to the participants is high-lighted in the following themes that emerged from the data: instructional methodology, student development, attitudes, empowerment, commitment, and effects of celebration. A service learning typology based on levels of service and learning is referenced. The author examines connections to the Future Problem Solving Program and discusses the implications for further research, the education of the gifted, and the community."

461,2003.0,To no longer educate the gifted: Programming for gifted students beyond the era of inclusionism,"To no longer educate the gifted: Programming for gifted students beyond the era of inclusionism   For many educators, the goal of tprograms for the gifted is ''the education of identified gifted students.'' This article argues that this goal makes gifted and talented (GT) programs vulnerable to discontinuation and relegates gifted children to inclusionary, regular classrooms where their needs are rarely met. To avoid these possibilities, the goal of GT should be reformulated to ''the development of gifted young adults.'' This goal has several advantages, including the possibility of a more enriched curriculum and a more diverse group of children with higher creative productive potential. It also includes the overt recognition that these children require both differentiated instruction and specialized guidance to acquire a measure of expertise, establish a strong sense of self, and make personally satisfying career choices. The Growing Giftedness model presented would have GT students work more closely with adults and with one another than the inclusionary model or part-time gifted programs can allow. In addition this model adumbrates the elements of a full-time program."
462,2003.0,Diagnosis of ADHD among gifted children in relation to KEDI-WISC and TOVA performance,"Diagnosis of ADHD among gifted children in relation to KEDI-WISC and TOVA performance   The following study was conducted to evaluate the correlation between intelligence and a Continuous Performance Test (CPT) that assesses. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in children. Characteristics of attention in gifted children with ADHD were also investigated. A sample of 177 elementary school students was studied, and their attention was measured with the Test of Variables of Attention (T.O.V.A.). About 9.4% of the gifted children were identified with ADHD using the T.O.V.A.) About 9.4% of the gifted children were identified with ADHD using the T.O.V.A., Child Behavior Check List (CBCL) and Teacher's Report Form (TRF). Significant positive correlations were found between intelligence (KEDI-WISC) and omission error, commision error, and response time (RT) variability on the T.O.V.A. That is, children with a high level of intelligence made fewer omission and commision errors and responded more consistently on the T.O.V.A. than children with lower intelligence. No significant correlation was found between intelligence and response time. Overall, gifted children performed better on the T.O.V.A. than nongifted children. Specifically, with the exception of response time variably, gifted children with ADHD performed better on tasks of omission error, commission error, and response sensitivity than nongifted children with ADHD. Further discussions are suggested based on the results mentioned above."
463,2003.0,Gender differences in gifted achievement in Britain and the US,"Gender differences in gifted achievement in Britain and the US   In Britain, the academic acheivements of gifted girls in grade school are surpassing those of gifted boys in almost all areas of study and at all ages, wheras this does not appear to be the case in the U.S. The evidence suggests 2 major reasons for this difference. Emotionally, British girls are now showing greater confidence in their abilities. Educationally, changes in the style and content of British curriculum and assessment may favor female study patterns, along with a national system of inspection that checks for equal gender opportunities in the classroom. Although this managed change in gender equality of opportunity in schools is seen to be highly effective, female school advantage has yet to make a significant difference in the workplace."
464,2003.0,Measuring the effectiveness of summer intensive physics courses for gifted students: A pilot study and agenda for research,"Measuring the effectiveness of summer intensive physics courses for gifted students: A pilot study and agenda for research   Students enrolled in 8 summer intensive physics courses for academically gifted students participated in a pilot study to assess the effectiveness of such courses. The students in each class completed the Force Concept Inventory (FCI), and the average normalised gains for each class were compared with previously published data from both year-long high school couses and semester long college courses. The average gains acheived by students in the intensive courses were comparable to those acheived by students in the intensive courses were comparable to those acheived by students in the ordinary-length courses. Recent work in physics education research has made such direct comparisons of standard-length and intensive physics courses possible and also suggests ways to improve student learning in both types of courses. Some further questions for research concerning intensive physics courses for gifted students are discussed."
465,2003.0,Early-entrance students: impressions of their first semester of college,"Early-entrance students: impressions of their first semester of college   Although the long-term impact of early entrance to college has been examined, one issue that has received inadequate attention in the gifted education literature is how students enrolled in early-entrance programs adjust during their first semester of college, which is arguably the most critical juncture for them in terms of their transition from high school. The purpose of this study was to identify the unique academic social, family and transition issues that challenged the inaugural class of the National Academy of Arts, Sciences, and Engineering (NAASE), an early entrance program at the University of Iowa. Through the use of in-depth interviews, behavioral observations, and student and parent surveys, a rich picture of the students satisfaction and challenges with their first-semester college experiences emerged. While the primary aim of this research was to examine the NAASE students first-semester adjustment, the study also served to evaluate the effectiveness of the NAASE program from the students perspectives."

The preliminary 32-item version of this inventory was constructed and then revised to reflect gifted students' adjustment problems in school and at home, based on feedback from teachers, students, and parents. The results of item factor analysis of the 32-item version yielded 6 problem dimensions/domains: relationship/ability concerns, unchallenging schoolwork, intense involvement, concerns for being different, parental expectations, and perfectionism. Students' self-report data indicated that strong feelings and involvement, unchallenging schoolwork, and high parental expectations could be common problems among gifted and talented students in Hong Kong. Implications of the findings for meeting the counseling needs of gifted students with adjustment difficulties, as well as suggestions for the refinement of the inventory and for cross-cultural investigations, are discussed."
469,2003.0,Elementary and middle school student participation in gifted programs: Are gifted students underserved?,"Elementary and middle school student participation in gifted programs: Are gifted students underserved?   Most researchers agree that special educational programming is advisable for academically gifted students, although the best type of programming is a matter of controversy. Evidence suggests that effective programs combine ability grouping with curricular modification, but little research has addressed the extent to which high-ability students receive special services in their schools. Here, third through sixth graders scoring at or above the 95th percentile on standardized achievement tests reported on their educational experiences. The most common experience was the pull-out program, but many students stated that they were involved in no special programming. Separate analyses for mathematics instruction yielded similar results. Gender, grade level, type of school (public vs. private/parochial), and above-level EXPLORE scores explained little of the variance in special accommodations. The lack of services reported by many participants is particularly surprising given that members of the sample were both highly able and highly motivated."
470,2003.0,Impact of gifted programs from the students' perspectives,"Impact of gifted programs from the students' perspectives   Fifty college students were interviewed about their prior experiences in gifted programs and their perspectives on the impact of these experience on their lives. Interview questions probed the types of experiences they remembered, including the types of instruction they had, their relations with peers, and their views about how their experiences in gifted programs affected other parts of their lives. Data were analyzed qualitatively with additional topics and themes emerging. In this paper, the author shares their voices and discusses the implications of their reports."
471,2003.0,Factors that differentiate underachieving gifted students from high-achieving gifted students,"Factors that differentiate underachieving gifted students from high-achieving gifted students   The purpose of this study was to examine whether gifted achievers and gifted underachievers differ in their general academic self-perceptions, attitudes toward school, attitudes toward teachers, motivation and self-regulation, and goal valuation. The sample consisted of 56 gifted underachievers and 122 gifted achievers from 28 high schools nationwide. Gifted achievers and gifted underachievers differed in their attitudes toward school, attitudes toward teachers, motivation/self-regulation, and goal valuation, but not their academic self-perceptions. In addition, the logistic regression analysis correctly classified over 81% of the sample as either gifted achievers or gifted underachievers using their motivation/self-regulation and goal valuation self-ratings. This study represents an important step toward quantifying factors related to the underachievement of gifted adolescents."
472,2003.0,Addressing underrepresentation of gifted minority children using the Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test (NNAT),"Addressing underrepresentation of gifted minority children using the Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test (NNAT)   A persistent problem in education is the underrepresentation of diverse students in gifted education programs. Many educators attribute the poor participation of diverse students in gifted programs to the ineffectiveness of standardized tests in capturing the ability of these students. Thus, a primary agenda of school selection committees is to find more culturally sensitive measures. This study examined the effectiveness of the Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test (NNAT) in identifying gifted Black and Hispanic students in comparison to White students. The sample was comprised of 20,270 students in grades K-12 who were similar to the U.S. population on several demographic variables. The distributions of NNAT standard scores were studied separately for White, Black, and Hispanic groups. Results indicate that similar percentages of white (5.6%), Black (5.1%), and Hispanic (4.4%) children earned an NNAT standard score of 125 (95th percentile rank). These findings suggest that the NNAT may be useful as part of a procedure to identify diverse students for gifted education services."
473,2003.0,Challenges and opportunities for students who are gifted: What the experts say,"Challenges and opportunities for students who are gifted: What the experts say   Five questions were answered by 64 authorities in the gifted field: (a) What do you see as the three greatest identification, assessment, and/or definitional issues in the gifted field? (b) What do you see as the three greatest curricula, instruction, and/or program issues for the gifted student? (c) What are the three most pressing unanswered questions in the gifted field? (d) What have been the three most important research findings in the last 5 years in the gifted field? (e) What are the three most significant developments or innovations in gifted education in the last 5 years? Responses were coded and sorted according to analytic strategy that permitted the descriptive data to be grouped into a small number of categories. Most frequent categories included a need for consensus on how to define, conceptualize, and identify giftedness; new procedures to increase the under-representation of gifted minority students; and the importance of translating research on educational innovations into practice. Research and practice implications for the gifted field provided."

477,2003.0,A national study of local and state advocacy in gifted education,"A national study of local and state advocacy in gifted education   This qualitative study examined advocacy in local and state contexts. Sixty-one examples of advocacy from 34 states were summarized through screening surveys sent to state directors of gifted education and to collaborative school districts from the National Research Center on the Gifted and Talented. Six sites were investigated further through case studies leading to the cross-case analysis that is reported in this paper. Overall, the study was guided by 2 questions. First, what do local and state advocacy efforts on behalf of gifted and talented children look like? Second, what factors facilitate positive outcomes for advocates? As defined by advocates, local and state advocacy ranges from short-term efforts in a single school building, to increased services for children, to complex, statewide initiatives to influence legislation, develop policies, and secure funding. Factors that support positive outcomes include advocates who are persistent, knowledgeable about both best practices in gifted education and local/state political processes, and more often collaborative than adversarial. The role of the champion, the importance of advocacy for acceptance, and the practical problem-solving skills and tools of individual advocates and groups of advocates are explored."

This research includes two accounts of advocacy events regarding gifted education. In both cases, the result was legislation for increased funding and services for the gifted. This research describes how people met the challenge of being supporters of gifted education. Both group processes and individual efforts were analyzed. Five ingredients of success represented the key characteristics common to the leaders in each group: passion, preparation, inspiration, perseverance, and the ability to take advantage of serendipity."

The state organization that is ready to truly make a difference in the way children are educated can take lessons from the initiatives and accomplishments recorded here. Understanding the dedication and detail necessary, reaping the benefits of this state's learning curve, and borrowing the strategies found to be successful will help your own organization's efforts. The analogy of bridge building makes concrete the less-tangible phases of getting a mandate for gifted education. This case study gives the blueprints for preparing those who will construct the mandate. Phase 1 entails educating all about the legislative process, building relationships and affiliate groups, getting technical help, and setting goals and making commitments. Phase 2 encompasses gaining recognition, keeping up the commitment, and learning how to compromise. Phase 3 follows a victory by publicizing the benefits, saying thanks, and developing the regulations. Phase 4 looks to the future by maintaining relationships and designing a new vision. There are important lessons and a wealth of ideas in this state's story."

In this article, the author presents findings and research of an advocacy event in Pulaski County, Arkansas, where one school district's efforts to desegregate their gifted program resulted in more Black students enrolled. Different phases of a Gifted Program Advocacy Model (G-PAM) are used to explain important components of the Pulaski County Special School District's advocacy efforts."

The policy All students who are capable of doing so will be provided accelerated and enriched instruction, is on the cutting edge of reform initiatives in both general and gifted education. High-end learning opportunities became available for all students who wanted to accept the challenge. This narrative yields insight into the factors that facilitated and impeded the advocacy efforts. The story reveals the importance of key individuals, commitment, tenacity, and the necessity of a system being in place for change to occur and for advocacy events to be successful. Participants wrestled with complex issues and questions that impact the field of gifted education. These issues are raised in the final section of the text."

The study is unique in that it follows the subject across his 21 years of life, highlighting relevant milestones and significant stages and events. A comprehensive view of the life and death of a gifted student is offered through both researchers' and parents' perspectives, along with multiple theoretical explanations, including a developmental explanation. This psychological autopsy yielded three sets of findings: those that reflected exclusively on the subject's life, those that compare his life with 3 previous psychological autopsies conducted, and those that reflect the parents' observations and experiences of his life. Two important findings of this study include a depiction of the psychological makeup of a subject in interaction with his environment and the fact that many of the factors contributing to suicidal behavior identified for the general population of adolescents and young adults existed in this case, as well. Consequently, as Cross, Cook, and Dixon (1996) found, certain types of aberrant behavior, belief systems, or both should not be considered a typical part of being a gifted person; they should be recognized as potential indicators of suicidal behavior."

The theory of successful intelligence, one such model, provides a basis for identification, intervention, and evaluation in gifted programs. This article descries the model, allowing practitioners and other interested parties to apply the model in a gifted education environment. The article contains four main parts. The first part presents the theory of successful intelligence and data in support of it. The second part shows how to implement the model in schools and presents data in support of the success of its school implementation. The third part relates the theory of successful intelligence to other models of gifted education. The fourth part briefly draws some conclusions."
487,2002.0,Family factors associated with high academic competence in former head start children at third grade,"Family factors associated with high academic competence in former head start children at third grade   Most studies of gifted students have looked at already identified groups, often convenience samples. This study takes a more epidemiological approach. Of the 5,400 children in the National Head Start/Public School Early Childhood Transition Demonstration Project tested at the end of third grade, the highest achieving 3% (N = 162) were selected by conducting a principal components analysis on their scores on the vocabulary and achievement measures. Compared with the remaining children, the high-achieving Children were thriving both socially and academically, and, although as a group they were not enamoured of school, fewer were strongly disaffected. On the whole, the families of these children had somewhat more resources on which to call and somewhat fewer stresses with which to deal than the families of the remaining children, although their mean income was only 1.26 times the Poverty Index. Compared to caretakers of the remaining children, caretakers of high achievers ascribed to more positive parenting attitudes and were seen by teachers as more strongly encouraging their children's progress. Of the 113 third-grade high achievers with test scores at grades 1, 2, and 3, 52 had met the 3% criterion in at least 2 grades, and 37 had done so in all 3. Years of high achievement correlated with family resources. These findings demonstrate that even families sorely stressed by life circumstances can support very positive intellectual and social competence in their children."

Through a qualitative case study approach, this study examined the factors influencing the sample's professional achievements. Major findings include each of the participants attributing a significant part of her identity to her status as a high achiever. This identity was influenced primarily by 3 factors: foundational influences, personality characteristics, and marriage as a partnership. The foundational influences were instrumental in shaping and directing the high-achieving component of the participants' identities. Specific attributes of their personalities provided the women with the tools necessary to transform their drive to achieve into actual accomplishments. Finally, defining their marriages as partnerships allowed each of them to view her identity in relation to another person and create a partnership that would empower both partners to achieve their goals. Implications of the findings are presented with suggestions for parents and educators that may help foster achievement in young gifted women."

The gap between research in these areas and the needs of gifted and talented learners is startlingly clear. This article includes information about the development of a rubric that was originally designed to assess the quality of curricular units that are submitted annually to the National Association for Gifted Children (NAGC) Curriculum Division's Curriculum Competition. The article also includes information about 4 different, but related, uses for the rubric. Ultimately, we hope that the use of this tool and assessment technique by practitioners across the country will begin to close the enormous gap between the learning needs of gifted and talented young people and curricula."

Efforts to find and serve these children require in-depth understanding of socioeconomic contexts that shape and subvert talent development. In this analysis, socioeconomic barriers to talent development are explored from the vantage points of major thinkers and recent research findings in context-sensitive disciplines such as economics, sociology and ethical philosophy. Insights drawn from these perspectives provide the basis for recommendations that educators of the gifted clarify conceptions of merit and ability; look for hidden socioeconomic influences on aspirations, motivation, and talent development; and engage in critical activism for deprived high-potential children."

Observations, interviews, and document review were conducted. The purpose of the school is to educate gifted and talented students not only for academics, but for motivation to help their state, country, and the world. The school is indigenous, based on the philosophy of Swami Vivekanada. The rhetoric of the field of the education of the gifted and talented is that bright students are our future leaders. This school in India seems geared to producing leaders than does current gifted education in the United States. The JP school seem to fall within the philosophies of Freire and Krishnamurti, who urged that education should lead to liberation of students' minds from the conditioning of society and then to the liberation of others."

This article examines historical styles of research conducted around the construct of gifted underachievement. It then explores possibilities of implementing alternative approaches and theoretical arguments in practical applications in this area. Goals include providing an overview of research focused on gifted underachievement, examining research positions (paradigms) that more vividly represent complexity inherent in educating gifted individuals, and providing precepts that guide practitioners and scholars to alternative views of the research process and use of research outcomes."
494,2002.0,Constructions of high academic achievement through the analysis of critical events,"Constructions of high academic achievement through the analysis of critical events   In this study, critical events in the career development of Finnish Academy professors describe the trajectories of their achievement and success throughout the lifespan. Focused open-ended interviews, curricula vitae, and field notes produced representations of high achievement, which in this article relate to the system model of talent, to the concept of successful intelligence, and, more widely, to the poststructural understanding of knowledge construction. The purpose of the article is to describe the primary themes resulting from descriptive analysis. These themes included mentors, academic years abroad, strong interest in the domain, and luck. Also described are the transformative themes, which comprised situated construction of academic career and reflectiveness that lay beyond the constitution of descriptive themes. Interpretation moves from descriptive to transformative analysis and is supported with the stories of Gatekeeper, Professional Leader, and Disappointed Idealist. These scientists' stories illustrate the situatedness and individualistic nature of scientific achievement, connecting and reconnecting issues of time, place, and in various ways."

Data from Plucker, Callahan, and Tomchin (1996) were reanalysed using CFA. I analyzed several models based on the theoretical conceptualization of the authors, their exploratory factor analysis and the subsequent reanalysis of the data by Pyryt (2000). Models that allowed for intercorrelations among factors fit better than those without such correlations. Although the performance tasks appeared to measure their constructs as predicted, a model with three factors that combined Linguistic and Interpersonal Intelligence, rather than the four original factors, was supported. Higher order models indicated the presence of a general factor underlying the multiple intelligences. Although not conforming exactly to the original theory it appears that this set of performance tasks is a step in the right direction in terms of measuring multiple intelligences. Pyryt's concern for the influence of g was confirmed to some extent, but it appears that both factors and individual tasks retain sufficient variance to allow for the interpretation that they measure separate abilities."

This study examined these questions in a sample of academically talented White and Asian American students. White students obtained significantly higher scores than Asian Americans in scholastic and job self-concepts, but the effect sizes were small. No domain-specific was a strong predictor of global self-concept for Asian American students, whereas self-concept related to appearance was a strong predictor of global self-concept for White students."
499,2002.0,Multiple creativities? Investigating domain-specificity of creativity in young children,"Multiple creativities? Investigating domain-specificity of creativity in young children   One of the most controversial issues in contemporary research on creativity-whether a person's creativity in domain-specific or domain-general was investigated with 109 second-grade children. The purposes of this study were to (1) provide empirical support for the domain-specific theory of creativity, (2) show relationships among children's creative performances as measured by three product-based assessments in three domains (storytelling, collage-making, and math word problems), and (3) explore the relationship between children's creative performances and their general creative thinking skills, as measured by the Wallach-Kogan Creative Thinking Test and the Real-World Divergent Thinking Test. The findings of this study support the position of domain-specificity of creativity. Children exhibited a range of creative abilities across different domains, rather than a uniform creative ability in diverse domains, indicating there is considerable intra-individual variation in creative ability by domain. Divergent thinking measures in this study did not predict creative performance in at least two of three, if not all, domains assessed in the study. Implications of the study in connection with educational practices for gifted children are discussed."
500,2002.0,Using performance tasks in the identification of economically disadvantaged and minority gifted learners: Findings from project STAR,"Using performance tasks in the identification of economically disadvantaged and minority gifted learners: Findings from project STAR   This paper discusses the rationale for developing performance assessment tasks to augment the identification of more economically disadvantaged and minority students for gifted programs in one state; provides a blue-print for the development protocol, including preteaching, rubrics, and exemplars; and shows major findings for use of the protocol with intended students. The performance assessment tasks were developed and revised based on try-out, pilot, and field test data collected across multiple districts with more than 4,000 students at primary and intermediate grades. Appropriate technical adequacy data. were used for decision making on rubric revisions. Criterion levels of performance within domains were developed to ensure inclusion of populations of interest without compromising the integrity of the task protocols. The performance assessment tasks of Project STAR resulted in finding an additional group of students who were 12% African American and 14% low-income children during the field test of the instrument. These students represent who would not have qualified for gifted programs using traditional-measures. In that sense, the assessment approach yields a value-added component to the state identification system. Thus, Project STAR provides an effective and innovative approach to finding more low-SES and minority gifted students for programs."
501,2002.0,Socioemotional factors contributing to adjustment among early-entrance college students,"Socioemotional factors contributing to adjustment among early-entrance college students   This study investigates the influence of self-concept and perceived family environment on psychosocial adjustment among early-entrance college students. Participants included 104 male and 76 female juniors at the Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science (TAMS). Scholastic aptitude, previous academic achievement, and family environment were employed as latent independent variables. Self-content, personal adjustment to TAMS, and academic achievement at TAMS were the latent dependent variables of the study. A series of regression models was used to assess the predictive utility of independent measures. The final model indicated that a combination of self-concept and family environment variables was able to predict psychosocial adjustment. Specifically, family cohesion, conflict, and expressiveness and overall self-concept were predictive of adjustment to college as measured by the total score of the Student Adjustment to College Questionnaire. For TAMS students, family cohesion, organization, control, conflict, and overall self-concept were found to predict academic achievement as measured by first semester grade-point average. it is recommended that applicant self-concept should be considered when educating students about considering early entrance to college, making program decisions, and instituting retention strategies for early-entrance college programs."
502,2002.0,Decisions regarding music training: Parental beliefs and values,"Decisions regarding music training: Parental beliefs and values   Musical talent development generally involves high levels of parental support over an extended period of time. This study examined parents' expectancy beliefs and values regarding their child's music training, regular academic work, and athletic activities. Parents of 231 students, aged 6-18, who attended programs at four music institutions responded to a questionnaire. The results suggest that parents may initially send their children for music training not for musical talent development per se, but for more general educational value. However, with more training and more advanced musical development, parents seem to regulate their beliefs and values across the store domains in the single-minded service of musical talent development."
503,2002.0,Examining perceptions of challenge and choice in classrooms: The relationship between teachers and their students and comparisons between gifted students and other students,"Examining perceptions of challenge and choice in classrooms: The relationship between teachers and their students and comparisons between gifted students and other students   In this study we investigated the relationship between what teachers report they do in their classrooms and their students' perceptions of classroom activities with pea-to-the dimensions of challenge and choice. students and teachers in elementary school classrooms (n = 91 classrooms) were analyzed separately from those in middle schools classrooms (n = 64 classrooms). No relationship existed between what teachers reported they do and what students perceived is clone at the elementary or middle school levels concerning the dimension of challenge. Further, concerning choice, a light positive correlation existed for elementary students, and their teachers, whereas no such relationship is at the middle school level. These findings suggest that what teachers report may not be what students actually experience in the classroom. Additionally, differences among perceptions of challenge and choice of gifted students in magnet schools, gifted students in regular schools, and other students in regular schools were investigated. Regarding challenge, magnet school gifted students reported signficantly more challenge than their gifted and, other peers at the middle school level whereas no such differences existed at the elementary level. No meaningful difference existed among the groups on the dimension of choice at either the elementary or middle school levels."

Salinger's wise children and gifted education   Gifted children are often Big Picture thinkers (Schultz & Delisle, 1997). Even as young children, they may ask profound questions and view life from the perspective of The Most Important Things: meaning, goodness, truth, spirituality, death, and the like. J. D. Salinger's stories about the gifted and precocious children offer a vivid, provocative, and very useful description of a spiritual Big Picture perspective on life. This essay describes the Glasses' spiritual development and draws out implications of their thinking and dilemmas for a critique of gifted education. It suggests that gifted education can adequately address the spiritual life of gifted students and other Big Picture perspectives only by becoming concerned h educating gifted children for life."
508,2002.0,Gifts and talents as sources of envy in high school settings,"Gifts and talents as sources of envy in high school settings   This article explores a new empirical approach to explaining some social difficulties experienced by talented students: peer envy toward their gifts and talents. A sample of 689 French Canadian high school students completed two questionnaires addressing both the envy they felt and the envy expressed toward them. The results focus on two themes: (a) the relative intensity and frequency of envy towards gifts and talents as compared to other potential objects of envy, and (b) the influence of various students characteristics or school settings on the student's answers. The results showed a large discrepancy between the envious and envied perspectives. In the first perspective, students did manifest more envy toward their peer's social and financial successes than toward their academic achievements or intelligence. On the other hand, when invited to identify objects for which they were envied, academic talent became the most frequently reported."

The study further explores the use of curriculum effectiveness data to improve instruction the next time a unit of study is sought. Findings suggest that the curriculum treatment produces both significant and important learning outcomes for gifted students across 18 school district entities. Implications for further research and practice are highlighted."
510,2002.0,Changing general education classroom practices to adapt for gifted students,"Changing general education classroom practices to adapt for gifted students   Ennded by the Jacob K. Javits Gifted and Talented Education Act, the Mustard Seed Project's major goal was to train teachers to differentiate curricula for gifted students in the general education classroom. This study addressed the changes in classroom practices and the factors that influenced these changes. Changes were measured using the Classroom Instructional Practices Scale (Johnsen, 1992). The sample included 1 urban and 5 rural sites, 8 principals, 74 teachers, 17 mentor teachers, and 18 community representatives. Throughout the two years of implementation, the majority of teachers at each site made changes. Changes in classroom practices and influencing factors were determined from interviews, field notes, formal and informal observations, and a final survey. Participants cited staff-development activities, leadership mentoring, resources, and project support as extremely beneficial."
511,2002.0,Perceptions of a self-contained class for fourth- and fifth-grade students with high to extreme levels of intellectual giftedness,"Perceptions of a self-contained class for fourth- and fifth-grade students with high to extreme levels of intellectual giftedness   This qualitative case study was designed to investigate the effectiveness of a new self-contained classroom curriculum that was differentiated for highly intellectually gifted students. The special class was investigated throughout its first year of operation in a mid-west school district. Participating students were and fifth graders with IQ scores on the Slosson Intelligence Test Revised ranging from 148 to 193. Data were collected using observations, interviews, comparison essays, and a goal-attainment scale. Qualitative data were analyzed using the techniques of open, axial, and selective coding, data displays, and peer debriefing; quantitative data were analyzed with descriptive statistics. The results suggested that the self-contained classroom provided a challenging learning environment for highly intellectually gifted students, but that the responses of individual students to this more challenging environment varied considerably, creating different emotional and social outcomes for specific students at different times during the school year. The results suggest that gifted and talented programming can have differential effects on individual students and that future program evaluation research should attempt to investigate the etiology of these differential effects."

Underinvolved and nonencouraging parents and teachers, negative parental attitudes toward work, family conflict, lack of career direction, and family transitions were found to be associated with underachievement. Both the adolescents and their parents achieved in nonacademic areas. Findings suggest that personality factors, achiever role models outside of the family developmental task accomplishment, changes in location, and new academic courses may contribute to reversal of underachievement."

Terman's most successful A group and the least successful C group were compared with respect to their identity formation. Significant relationships were found between identity formation and occupational success at the data points under study. The successful As were found to be mostly Identity Achievers, whereas the unsuccessful Cs were more likely Identity Diffusers. The explanation power of Erikson's identity theory for varied achievement in adulthood calls for attention to identity research in gifted education."

Previous studies examining these relationships were based on an open-ended questionnaire and small samples. This study uses a new self-rating questionnaire to assess overexcitabilities, the Overexcitability Questionnaire II, and findings are based on a large sample of 562 university students. Gifted-ness was measured by a student's participation in either a gifted, advanced, or standard curriculum program. Results show that previous findings on the relationship between giftedness and overexcitability can be confirmed.; gifted students scored significantly higher on intellectual and emotional overexcitability than students in either of the other two programs. Further, males scored higher overall on intellectual, ima national, and psychomotor overexcitability, while females scored higher on emotional and sensual overexcitability."

A pretest-posttest control group design was used, in which students were randomly assigned to one of two experimental groups or to a control group during a summer enrichment program offered to talented students. Although the literature suggests that cooperative learning settings, particularly single-gender groups, are more beneficial for females, no statistical differences in achievement or self-efficacy were found among the groups. Statistically significant differences in attitudes toward mathematics were found favoring students in the whole-group instruction, competitive setting."

Participants consisted of 804 academically talented students (433 females, 371 males) attending a summer program. Data were self-reported and were collected on a program evaluation questionnaire. Males enrolled in traditionally male (TM) courses in significantly greater numbers than they enrolled in traditionally female (TF) courses, but female enrollment in the two types of courses was more equal. Asian American students' course enrollment in TM and TF courses was more balanced than non-Asian American student enrollment, and Asian American students endorsed fewer internal reasons than non-Asian students did. Students in TM classes endorsed more external reasons for course choice than their colleagues in TF classes. Finally, students who gave more internal reasons for course choice reported enjoying classes more than students who gave more external reasons. No gender differences in motivation were found."

Through a qualitative research design that integrated case study and ethnographic research, the investigation examined the lives of 6 high-ability males in an inner-city high school to understand how their urban life experiences influenced their underachievement. The 6 cases reported in this study are a subset of 12 cases (Hebert, 1993) that contributed to a larger study (Reis, Hebert, Diaz, Maxfield, & Ratley, 1995) of talented students an urban high school. Major findings uncovered in chronicling the lives of 6 underachievers included: inappropriate curricular and counseling experiences, problematic family issues, a negative peer group and environmental influences, and discipline problems. Implications of these findings are presented, as are suggestions meeting the educational needs of high-ability underachieving young men in urban secondary schools."
522,2001.0,Lessons from another field: Applying coteaching strategies to gifted education,"Lessons from another field: Applying coteaching strategies to gifted education   Because research has found that differentiation of instructed for gifted students does not typically occur within the general classroom, collaboration between gifted and general education teachers is critical in order in order to ensure appropriate services to students with high abilities, Gifted education teachers are now being called upon to provide services to their students in the regular education environment. This fundamental change in setting mirrors mandated changes in special education, wherein students with disabilities are increasingly served in the general education classroom. This article provides a new definition of collaboration within the context of gifted education and expands on the utilization of coteaching ar a collaborative strategy. Five models pf coteaching originally developed for meeting the needs of students with disabilities were adapted and examples of their use with gifted students in the general education classroom are provided."
523,2001.0,The processing of analogous problems in the verbal and visual-humorous (cartoons) modalities by gifted/average children,"The processing of analogous problems in the verbal and visual-humorous (cartoons) modalities by gifted/average children   Children encounter problem solving in their formal schooling mainly in the verbal modality, whereas they are exposed to cartoons in their leisure time in a context perceived as nonlearning and nonthreatening. Yet, cartoons can be conceived of as problems in the visual-humorous modality, analogous to verbal problems. This article examines how gifted and average children solve analogous problems in these two modalities (verbal and visual), including their ability to consciously transfer solutions from one modality to the other. Specifically, four variables are considered: (1) the correctness solutions of analogous problems in both modalities; (2) the students' perceived difficulty of these problems; (3) their awareness of the correctness of their solutions; and (4) their awareness of the contribution of a learned source problem in one modality to the solution of an analogous Ir problem in the other. Gifted children, as expected, better on the verbal problems, but improved their skills in both modalities once exposed to the solution of analogous problems in the visual-humorous modality. Average children tended to solve cartoons better than verbal. problems, but working with cartoons increased their verbal problem-solving skills. Results suggest that cartoon solving in the classroom can enhance the problem-solving capabilities of both populations."
524,2001.0,"Goals, attention, and video game performance among gifted children","Goals, attention, and video game performance among gifted children   Gifted children's goals for learning on their video game performance and patterns of attention were examined. Before playing a game, second- and fifth-graders were instructed to adopt an evaluative, process, outcome, or no specific goal focus while playing. Children were then asked about the game strategies and game features they attended to while playing. Older children showed better performance overall and their best performance when instructed to adopt an evaluative goal. Younger children showed their worst performance in the same condition. This developmental pattern of findings was reversed among children instructed to adopt an outcome goal. Postgame responses indicated developmental differences in game features, strategies, and evaluation assessments. Most children across both grades made reference to process goals. These findings provide preliminary support for the hypothesis that gifted children's goals for learning impact their performance and attention and that this impact may be influenced by their developmental level."

Locally designed identification measures, developed by teachers and community members, were found to be appropriate by teachers and staff if several different measures were used. In research about identification of students for Project ARTS, scores on the Torrance Tests of Creativity, Clark's Drawing Abilities Test, and state achievement tests were found to be correlated. Except at one site, gender was not found to be a significant variable on these tests. It was recommended that local measures, the CDAT, and achievement tests be used to identify artistically talented students in rural communities with populations similar to those in Project ARTS."

There continues to be a vast disconnect between policy analysts and gifted educators. The objective of this article is to help bridge that gap by (1) intoducing a set of policy tools for measuring the outcomes of gifted education policies and (2) applying those tools to data on the distribution of gifted education spending and designated personnel in the state of Texas. According to generally accepted policy benchmarks, the analyses performed indicate (a) continued vast inequities across school districts in the availability of resources and (b) unacceptable correlations between student population characteristics, community wealth, and the availability of opportunity."

We examined behavioral, cognitive, attentional, and family history dimensions among four groups of 87 boys: High Gifted (IQ 140-154), Low Gifted (IQ 124-139), Learning Disabled, and a Normal control group. Findings indicated that High Gifted boys exhibit levels of behavior problems similar to the Learning Disabled, whereas Low Gifted boys demonstrate significantly lower levels of behavioral problems than do the Learning Disabled boys. These data provide support for the view of the gifted population as heterogeneous, with the High Gifted exhibiting more behavioral problems than the Low Gifted."

Dimensions of preferred learning activities common for gifted and nongifted students included factors interpretable as learning through verbal interaction, learning by role-play, and learning by doing. Comparing gifted and nongifted students, gifted students indicated significantly greater preferences for learning styles related to interpersonal verbal exchanges and autonomous learning. Although there were no significant gender differences in learning style preferences, the younger age group indicated significantly greater preference for learning styles related to structured activities and games than the older age group. Plausible reasons for the differences between the present findings and findings from non-Chinese settings regarding the learning styles of gifted students are discussed."

This system provides a method of communication and translation between disciplines (e.g., academics, arts, athletics) that serves multiple educational purposes as it honors individual development in areas of expertise. Individual differences are highlighted that begin to map aptitudes and achievements in multiple domains and offer a range of five levels of expectations/benchmarks for the high-end learner. Record keeping of the development of expertise in talent domains will also inform future research currently devoid of longitudinal, biographical data."

We believe that dissociation of these two aspects is conditional, not a constant state of affairs. We identify those contingencies and processes that are responsible for the dissociation. We also believe that integration of these two perspectives is not only possible, but crucial for the well-rounded development of persons who have been the targeted populations of special services for the gifted and talented. One way to achieve this integration is to reconceptualize talent, achievement/success, and productivity in a way that illuminates the intrinsic connections between talent development and personal growth."
549,2000.0,Wisdom as a form of giftedness,"Wisdom as a form of giftedness   This article describes an important, yet largely neglected, kind of giftedness, namely, wisdom. First, the article discusses how giftedness is identified currently. Second, the article presents an alternative view based on a balance theory of wisdom. The theory is described, and it is shown why the theory offers a useful way of conceptualizing wisdom. Finally, the article concludes that, given the state of the world, we should have a strong incentive to identify and develop wisdom as a form of giftedness."

The results indicted that many gifted dropouts were from low socioeconomic-status families and racial minority groups; had parents with low levels of education; and participated less in extracurricular activities. Also, reasons for gifted male dropouts were more related to economic issues, while reasons for gifted female dropouts were more related to personal issues, although both males and females were likely to offer school-related reasons. The logistic regression analysis results indicated that dropout behavior for gifted students was significantly related to students' educational aspirations, pregnancy or child-rearing, gender, father's highest level of education, and mother's highest level of education."

The process of defining underachievement, identifying underachieving gifted students, and explaining the reasons for this underachievement continues to stir controversy among practitioners, researchers, and clinicians. Despite this interest, the underachievement of gifted students remains an enigma. This article reviews and analysis three decades of research on the underachievement of gifted students in an attempt to clarify the present state of research. The problems inherent in defining and identifying underachieving gifted students are given special attention. The authors also include suggestions for those interested in pursuing potentially promising new lines of research and inquiry in this area."

Two questionnaires were administered to 296 gifted and mainstream eight graders from Singapore. Clinical interviews provided insights into students' tacit understanding of self so as to shed some light on practical abilities that may underlie broad notions of success. Results indicated a marginal association between practical and academic a marginal association between practical and academic abilities and suggest that academically gifted children are no different from mainstream children in the solution of practical problems. regardless of academic ability, children high in practical intelligence displayed a height-ended sense of self and a keener awareness of the hidden curriculum, school smartness, and successful adaptation to environments, true common sense must point toward a need to help children reach for a gestalt in making meaning of their lives."

Students identified as gifted and nongifted students did not differ significantly on extroverted-introverted, organized-flexible, and thinking-feeling styles. Students identified as gifted displayed a stronger preference for imaginative styles, while nongifted children displayed a stronger preference for practical styles. Gender differences were significant. Boys displayed a stronger preference for flexible and thinking styles while girls displayed a stronger preference for organized and feeling styles. Two gifted-by-gender interactions also wer significant. Compared with boys identified, girls identified as gifted were more likely tp prefer imaginative styles. Furthermore, although boys generally expressed a stronger preference for thinking than feeling, non-gifted boys expressed a stronger preference for thinking than did boys identified as gifted."

A response to Pyryt   Pyryt has raised important questions about the results reported in Plucker, Callahan, and Tomchin (1996). Although Pyryt's comments focus directly on statistical issues upon which we generally agree), he indirectly touches on some major issues related to contemporary intelligence theory and the use of alternative assessments. Our different approaches to these conceptual issues highlight important areas for future research and practice, illustrating the value of this type of intellectual debate for the fields of gifted education and talent development."
558,2000.0,Mentors for gifted underachieving males: Developing potential and realizing promise,"Mentors for gifted underachieving males: Developing potential and realizing promise   The literature focusing on mentorships and underachieving gifted young men is almost nonexistent. To address this need, the researchers examined the mentorship experiences of three students who characterized various aspects of giftedness and underachievement in males. The findings of the study revealed a single core category with three attendent subcategories. The influence of a significant adult on a young person was the dominant category. Several related subcategories reinforced the importance of the mentor: mentors' open-minded and nonjudgmental characteristics; consistent and personalized social/emotional strategies and advocacy; and strength and interest-based strategies for intervention to reverse underachievement. These results underscore the critical effectiveness of mentorships, on underachievement, regardless of age, environment, and socioeconomic background. Implications of the findings are presented that highlight the successful features of the mentor-protege relationship."

Perceptions of students, parents, and teachers   Secondary analysis of descriptive data concerning musically gifted students, their parents, and their teachers yields distinctive attribution patterns for each group. The patterns describe this group of students as attributing much of their success to inborn ability and hard work. These accomplished students, however, describe family members and friends as discouraging their musical development. Parents, in sharp contrast, report their children as having only ordinary levels of inborn talent, and they attribute their children's musical accomplishments to encouragement provided by family and friends. Teachers in this study attribute students' musical development to innate talent, hard work, and schooling. Differences among these attribution patterns are surprising, but are consistent with research that suggests that individuals often make causal attributions that are self-serving, giving a good deal of credit to their own characteristics or influence."
562,2000.0,Defining belief in self: Intelligent young men in an urban high school,"Defining belief in self: Intelligent young men in an urban high school   To address the paucity of research on high-ability youth in urban environments, this article chronicles the experiences of six intelligent young men in an urban high school. Through a qualitative research design that integrated features of case study and ethnographic research, the study examined how urban life experiences influenced academic achievement. The six cases reported in this study are a subset of 12 cases (Hebert, 1993) that contributed to a larger study (Reis, Hebert, Diaz, Maxfield, & Ratley, 1995) of talented students in an urban high school. Major findings for the high-ability achieving males were a strong belief in self that incorporated an inner will, aspirations, heightened sensitivity, and a multicultural awareness and appreciation. Data analysis on the participants identified the following factors that influenced the strong belief in self: relationships with supportive adults; involvement in extracurricular activities, sports, special programs, and summer school experiences; and family support. Implications of the findings are presented along with suggestions for meeting the educational needs of intelligent young men in urban high schools."
563,2000.0,Assessing leadership among Chinese secondary students in Hong Kong: The use of the Poets Rating Scale for Leadership,"Assessing leadership among Chinese secondary students in Hong Kong: The use of the Poets Rating Scale for Leadership   The leadership characteristics of 163 Chinese secondary students in Hong Kong were assessed with the use of the Roets Rating Scale for Leadership (RRSL). Higher self-ratings were found for characteristics related to aspiring to leadership and achievement, openness to novel experiences and different perspectives, and high energy level than for other characteristics. Three dimensions identifiable as task orientation, leadership self-efficacy, and leadership flexibility emerged, testifying to the complexity of leadership skills and characteristics. The study also provided evidence that the RRSL was a viable self-report measure of leadership among Chinese adolescents with acceptable reliability and convergent validity with other measures of leadership based on observed behavioral characteristics. Repeated assessment also indicated that the RRSL could be used to monitor the effects of leadership training programs."
564,2000.0,Compensation strategies used by high-ability students with learning disabilities who succeed in college,"Compensation strategies used by high-ability students with learning disabilities who succeed in college   To investigate how high-ability students with learning disabilities succeed in postsecondary academic environments, 12 young adults with disabilities who were successful at the university level were studied. Extensive interviews with these young adults provided examples of the problems faced by high-ability students with learning disabilities, as well as the specific compensation strategies they used to address and overcome these problems. Four of the participants had been identified as having a learning disability in elementary school; and two were not diagnosed until college. The participants believed that having a learning disability was considered by elementary or secondary school personnel as synonymous with below-average ability. The reported that content remediation, other than instruction in compensatory strategies, was usually provided in elementary and secondary school learning disability programs. In this article, the compensation strategies used by academically gifted students who succeeded in college are discussed. These include: study strategies, cognitive/learning strategies, compensatory supports, environmental accommodation, opportunities for counseling, self-advocacy, and the development of an individual plan incorporating a focus on metacognition and executive functions."

Achievement and aptitude test-data and qualitative data collected during the students' first year at the school support the conclusion that the students were appropriately placed and adjusted well academically, socially, and emotionally. Follow-up data suggest that the students' academic careers have, in the six years since the original data were collected, for the most gait progressed well. We present assertions that begin to explain why students have succeeded academically despite being at risk for educational disadvantage. These assertions concern the students themselves, their families, their school and Project Synergy, through whose activities the students were identified as potentially gifted."

Shopping routes through a model grocery store mere planned by 30 average-ability and 20 high-ability preschool children. All subjects planned a total of five shopping trips. The first and last trips were completed alone, while the three middle trips were either completed alone, with a same-ability peer, or with a peer of different ability. Data were analyzed with a series of multivariate is of variance (MANOVA) with a within-subjects representing the measure of planning skill across Lists 2, 3, and 4. Results indicates that preschool-aged,did not differ in planning skill on the basis of ability. In addition, high-ability preschoolers performed equally when working alone, with a peer or with a peer of less ability."
571,2000.0,Self-concept in gifted youth: An investigation employing the Piers-Harris subscales,"Self-concept in gifted youth: An investigation employing the Piers-Harris subscales   The Piers-Harris Children's Self-Concept Scale was used to investigate the self-concept of 368 intellectually gifted children in grades 4-12. Previous research had suggested that differences by gender and grade level might be masked by reporting only global self-concept scores; however, few studies reported subscale scores. In this population, gender was not a significant variable for global self-concept. Significant gender differences were observed on three subscales: Behavior, Intellectual and School Status, and Anxiety. Females rated themselves higher on the first two and males on the latter. School level was a significant variable for global self-concept: students in junior high school reported lower self-concept than did students in either elementary school or high school. Similar results were observed with the Behavior subscale. The present study supports the view that a global score for self-concept can mask underlying differences when subscale scores are summed."

Students experienced the most difficulty in exploring and forming a focus. Although students used a variety of information resources, they did not access some available information sources and, in some cases, experienced difficulty extracting relevant information. The professional services of public and school librarians were not utilized to assist in the research project. Only 3 of the 10 gifted students demonstrated all of the characteristics of authentic learning in their final products. Suggestions are made on how to alter the process to make independent research projects produce more authentic learning experiences."

Both quantitative and qualitative methodologies were used. Although the cluster grouping program was originally designed to preside differentiation of content and instruction for gifted students, Fosiive effects were also found on the achievement of all students in the school. During the three program years, students involved in the school using cluster grouping were more likely to be identified as high achieving or above average. Fewer students were identified as low achieving. A significant increase in achievement test scores of all students was found when these students were compared to similar students from a comparison school district. Qualitative analyses yielded three core cate- gories-the use of grouping, the impact of teachers, and the general school environment-that helped to provide an understanding of the quantitative findings."
576,1999.0,DISCOVER: A promising alternative assessment for the identification of gifted minorities,"DISCOVER: A promising alternative assessment for the identification of gifted minorities   Based on the general framework of Gardner's (1983) theory of multiple intelligences and Maker's (1996) definition of giftedness, the DISCOVER process is a performance-based assessment designed to identify gifted students from culturally diverse groups. The process consists of five activities through which linguistic, logical-mathematical, and spatial intelligences are appraised. In this review, I describe the assessment and review preliminary studies on its reliability and validity. The DISCOVER assessment seems to be a promising alternative technique through which the problem of underrepresentation of gifted minorities in programs for the gifted I might be reduced. However, educators using the DISCOVER assessment for identification purposes must make sure that a good match exists between the assessment and the type of gifted program in which students will be placed."
577,1999.0,Comparison of traditional and problem solving assessment criteria,"Comparison of traditional and problem solving assessment criteria   Identifying students who are gifted has been grounded traditionally in criteria emphasizing unitary measures of intellectual ability, which has caused great concern for educators interested in identifying academic talent and potential in culturally and linguistically diverse students. Recently, multiple intelligences (MI) theory has been examined as an alternative perspective with promise for addressing concerns evident in groups identified using traditional methods. To date, research on the effectiveness of assessment practices grounded in MI theory has been sparse. The purpose of this research was to describe the performance of elementary school children on an alternative screening measure designed for use in identifying students who are gifted. The Problem Solving Assessment procedure represented an application of MI theory, and decisions made using it were compared to those that would be made using a more traditional, unitary approach to identification. Positive relations were evident among scores for different types of intelligences and between them and the traditional measure. More importantly, different groups of students were identified using each approach, with a more diverse population generated with the Problem Solving Assessment procedure. The results are discussed with regard to ongoing practices and future directions in gifted education."
578,1999.0,Elementary student talent searches: Establishing appropriate guidelines for qualifying test scores,"Elementary student talent searches: Establishing appropriate guidelines for qualifying test scores   Traditionally talent searches administer college entrance examinations to seventh and eighth graders who score in the top 3-5% on in-grade achievement tests. Research dating back to the 1970s indicates that talent searches effectively provide a specific assessment of ability level in these gifted students. More recently, the talent search model has been. applied to third- through sixth-grade gifted students. The Elementary Student Talent Search, for example, uses EXPLORE (a test designed for eighth graders) as an above-level test. Very little research has been conducted on the talent search model as applied to elementary students, however. Our data indicate that talent participants earn EXPLORE scores that:are approximately normally distributed and that they:compare: favourably to eighth-grade norms. EXPLORE scores below chance level are rare. Raising the requirements :for Talent Search eligibility would increase the number of false negatives more than it would decrease false positives."

The model was synthesised from original studies contributed by more that 20 scholars, psychologists, and educators, known collectively as Remarkable women: Perspectives on Female Talent Development (Arnold, Noble, & Subotnik, 1996). Key issues addressed by this model are the personal, professional, and cultural challenges common to gifted females as well as strategies for coping with them, spheres of influence and achievement to which gifted women aspire, and ways to help gifted women and girls identify and actualise their talents and gifts."

The published and unpublished papers, memoranda, and research field notes of these researchers, their respective correspondence with Terman and each other, and some contacts with a living member of the research team and family members were used for this analysis. Although the information is incomplete on some of the women, most of them appeared to have had satisfying personal lives in addition to productive professional careers. Not only did they each contribute greatly to the actual work of carrying out Terman's research conception, they also represent a continium of life-long productivity. Personal responsibilities may have had more to do with their subsequent levels of productivity than societal expectations or conventions."

The participants in this stage of the study were 540 Year & students comprising 402 gifted students grouped in selective high schools, 76 gifted students grouped in accelerated cohorts, and a mixed ability group of 62 students. The preliminary analysis of self-reports from the total population of students who participated in the first stage of this study, including principal component analysis and multiple regression analyses, supports the social-constructivist conceptual framework proposed. The hypothesized positive correlation between the Quality of School Life variables and Intrinsic Motivation was confirmed. The positive correlations between the Anxiety and Tedium variables and the corresponding negative correlation with Quality of School Life variables lent support for the theoretical rationale underpinning the inclusion of measures of boredom."

As predicted scores on the TTCT and CBCL were statistically unrelated. Also as predicted, scores for the CBCL were very similar to national norms (Achenbach, 1991) and represented an absence of behavior disorders. Contrary to expectations, TTCT scores were slightly below national norms (Torrance, 1990c).

The research reported here describes the impact of the study's interventions on preservice teachers attitudes, beliefs, and practices as they relate to academically diverse learners. All participants completed a survey designed to assess their attitudes, beliefs, and practices regarding struggling and gifted learners prior to and upon completion of the interventions. Using a univariate repeated analysis of variance technique statistically significant differences were found between the two intervention groups attitudes toward differentiation. Results suggest that is novices become more acquainted with the realities of the classroom, they gain a clear picture of the complexity involved in appropriate curriculum modifications to address the academic needs of diverse learners."

A longitudinal case study clarifies this process. The analysis and discussion of the problems reveal clues for prevention in kindergarten and subsequent forms of education. Each child entering kindergarten could be included in a screening procedure in which parents of the child. Relevant differences in development between students could be basic to part of the pedagogical, play, and didactic characteristics provided for in kindergarten. The curricular and instructional aspects of this student-based instruction effect changes in teachers' pedagogical focus and helps them in realizing challenging adjustments in the play and learning activities offered. Two cases in which suggested strategies are utilized illustrate what this means for gifted children and their teachers. Positive effects may become greatest for students whose level of development is either clearly higher or lower than that of their age mates in one or more aspects."

Howard Gardner (1993) has made a cogent argument for the inclusion of musical intelligence in the spectrum of human intelligences. He has proposed that this musical ability may evolve in different ways. One of these is the crystallizing experience, a dramatic event in a person's life that makes manifest inherent giftedness. The crystallizing experience may serve as useful construct for explaining how certain talented individuals first commit themselves to an area of giftedness. The present study involved 24 musically precocious boys of middle school age who were asked questions, individually and in focus groups, regarding the nature of crystallizing experiences. This study of the crystallizing experience revealed important implications for understanding the structure and composition of extraordinary performance."

Participants consisted of parents of 477 students in kindergarten through grade 6 who attended a summer program for the academically talented. Using a modified version of the Homework Problem Checklist (Anesko, Schofock, Ramirez, & Levine, 1987), parents provided information on students' responses to completing homework, the amount of homework given in school, and the amount of time spent assisting with homework. Parents also gave an estimate of the amount of homework that should be assigned in a summer academic program. Results indicated that academically talented students completed homework with few negative responses and most parents indicated that homework should be given during an academic summer program. Whereas amount of homework assigned in school and amount of proposed summer homework increased with grade level, the amount of time parents spent assisting with homework did not increase beyond first grade."

Participants were five families, each of which included gifted children and at least one parent presently or recently in the military. Study 1 involved elementary students living on a military base, and students in Study 2 attended suburban high schools. While academic performance was not hindered by moving, parents and students reported that organizational inconsistencies among schools (e.g., widely varying criteria for admittance to gifted programs) were a frequent cause of frustration. Frequent relocations had little impact on parent and student perceptions of the gifted children's long-term social, emotional, and academic development. In the short term, however, certain children experienced varying degrees of social difficulties that appeared to result from the relocations."

Theories are, however, not value-neutral explanations, but complex attempts to serve human goals that contain values and ideas for action, as well as explanations. When there is a disjunction between a theory and ideas about what is good for gifted children, the latter should he our guide. The most important value in gifted education, we argue, should be child-centeredness. Theories can serve this value by helping us to understand the perspective of a gifted child. Most models and theories (Maslow's and Dabrowski's being the primary exceptions) address the conditions that promote gifted achievement and do not illuminate the inner life of gifted children. And yet, the pressure to achieve often has negative consequences for the emotional well-being of the child. Roeper's education for self-actualization and interdependence offers an approach to gifted education that respects the inner life of gifted children and assists them in finding their own way in life."

This work reveals how emerging youth leadership differs from established measures and leadership theories drawn from adults. Views and enactments of leadership among the young focus on how leadership happens, not on who leaders are as power figures, skillful managers, or individuals bearing specific traits. These perspectives from youth carry strong links to recent work in cognitive psychology and organizational sociology that maintains the key importance of adaptation, engagement with situation, and distribution of knowledge and roles."

According to this approach, the prodigy phenomenon is a result of the extremely accelerated mental development during sensitive periods that leads to the rapid growth of a child's cognitive resources and their construction into specific cognitive experience. The latter is the psychological basis of extraordinary intellectual creative achievements and expresses itself in the prodigy's unique intellectual picture of the world. The psychological nature of the prodigy phenomenon is therefore formed by sensitive periods that should be viewed as its fundamental mechanism and by cognitive experience. This approach explains both the process of the prodigy phenomenon (i.e., prodigious development) and its product (i.e., prodigies' exceptional performance and achievements)."

A discussion of the use of the consultation model within a gifted education program concludes the article."

605,1998.0,A national study of science curriculum effectiveness with high ability students,"A national study of science curriculum effectiveness with high ability students   This study assessed student growth on integrated science process skills after being taught a 20-36 hour science unit. The prototypical unit, Acid, Acid Everywhere, was implemented in 15 school districts across seven states. Although seven science units for high ability learners have been developed through a federally funded project, the student outcome results only from Acid, Acid Everywhere, the most widely replicated unit, are reported here. All units were based on the Integrated Curriculum Model (ICM) developed specifically for gifted learners; the mode stresses advanced content, high level process and product, and a concept dimension. Results indicate small, but significant, gains for students integrated science process skills when compared to equally able students not using the units. Implementation data reflected satisfaction of teachers with the units, especially in terms of student interest and motivation. The effectiveness of this curriculum, designed to align with the new science standards and to be appropriate for gifted students, lends credibility to the argument for using the new content standards as a basis for curriculum development efforts with gifted learners."
606,1998.0,Open-ended activities: Differentiation through learner responses,"Open-ended activities: Differentiation through learner responses   This article explores the meaning of curricular differentiation for identified gifted students by examining learner responses to open-ended activities. Very little research supports or describes how open-ended activities-which have been advocated as a strategy to allow students to work in their own interest areas, in their own learning styles, and at their own ability level-serve to differentiate the curriculum. This paper sets curriculum differentiation in a historical perspective, reviews a comprehensive investigation into the nature of open-ended activities, and focuses on how and in what ways the responses to open-ended activities of children identified as a gifted differed from responses of children who were not identified as gifted in a third-grade a fourth-grade heterogeneously grouped classroom. The study also focuses on teacher perceptions of classroom activities and learner responses. Data sources included observations over the course of one academic year, interviews with teachers and students, learning style and interest assessment instruments, and documents related to over 33 open-ended activities. Based on the findings reported here, the author proposes a reexamination of the meaning of curricular differentiation with a renewed emphasis on determining how an instructional strategy, for example, providing open-ended activities, maximizes student's capabilities."
607,1998.0,Gifted education meets Reggio Emilia: Visions for curriculum in gifted education for young children,"Gifted education meets Reggio Emilia: Visions for curriculum in gifted education for young children   The purpose of this article is to explore the relationships in curriculum thinking, development, and implementation between gifted education and early childhood education. Young gifted children (ages birth to eight) are among the most underserved populations of gifted children; yet, we know that early intervention has a significant effect on their continued development. In this article, we provide a review of the current curriculum models used in gifted child education and early childhood education, focusing on a comparison of the two. We examine the role of the child in the curriculum making, the voice of the parents, and the responsibilities of the teacher. Finally, we turn our attention to the Reggio Emilia approach to early childhood education as a means to expand our view of curriculum, the importance of the environment, and the crucial need to use the child's needs, interests, and abilities as the initial and sustaining focus of curriculum development."
608,1998.0,For the good of humankind: Matching the budding talent with a curriculum of conscience,"For the good of humankind: Matching the budding talent with a curriculum of conscience   For most of this century, educators have debated the types of different curriculum highly able students require in order to realize their contribution to self and society (Gallagher et al., 1969; Marland, 1971; Milne, 1979; Passow, 1958, 1979, 1985; Renzulli, 1982; Tannenbaum, 1979; Tomlinson, 1995; Ward, 1961). Wherein lies the inspiration for the kind of human endeavor that talent development and, ultimately, creative expression engender? This paper traces the rationale for the development and unique talents to the eminent philosopher William James (1902) and suggests a relationship between this highly personal process and the maturity of one's ethos, or ethical world view. Is one element of talent development, ethical behavior, to benefit humankind? If so, what types of curricular opportunities do we need to provide bright, talented children and youth to stretch their current boundaries, to challenge them as they need to be challenged, and to stimulate them to use their creativity productively to make their world a better place?"
609,1998.0,From Passow to Gardner: Curriculum for talent development,"From Passow to Gardner: Curriculum for talent development   As one of the early pioneers in gifted education, A. Harry Passow was a strong advocate for curricula that considered the total learning environment as a means of nurturing students' individual gifts and talents. His classic description of four curricula (general, specialized, covert, and nonschool educative) the impact gifted learners is relevant in schools where gifted students may spend the majority of their day in a general education classroom. This article illustrates how Harry Passow's views on curriculum and talent development are similar to those of Howard Gardner and how the author has used both theorists' views to develop a student-centered curriculum planning model. The model has been field-tested in general education classrooms and shows promise for creating a stimulating learning environment to nurture students' talents."
610,1998.0,A national curriculum and the sovereignty of higher ability learners,"A national curriculum and the sovereignty of higher ability learners   Over the past half-century, the British education system has undergone three major changes in relation to higher ability pupils: an extension of opportunity for very able working class children to attend selective, state-funded grammar schools; a leveling out of opportunities within state-funded schools by abolishing the 11-plus examination, the purpose of which was to select higher ability pupils for grammar school entry; and the introduction of a National Curriculum, imposing statutory curriculum requirements for all state funded schools. The main focus of this paper is on the last of the three and the way in which British teachers perceive how the National Curriculum may have affected educational opportunities and sovereignty of higher ability pupils."

614,1998.0,Dynamic assessment and its use with underserved gifted and talented populations,"Dynamic assessment and its use with underserved gifted and talented populations   A relatively close new nontraditional approach to assessing cognitive ability is to instruct students on how to perform on certain tasks and then measure their progress in learning to solve similar problems. This approach, called dynamic assessment, usually consists of a test-intervene-retest format that focuses attention on the improvement in student performance when an adult provides mediated assistance on how to master the testing task. The dynamic assessment approach can provide a means for assessing disadvantaged, disabled, or limited English proficiency students who have not demonstrated high ability on traditional tests of intelligence and creativity. Dynamic assessment methods should be considered by school districts with large numbers of disadvantaged students which are dissatisfied with the effectiveness of traditional methods for identifying students for specialized enrichment programs."
615,1998.0,Family factors associated with high academic competence among former head start children,"Family factors associated with high academic competence among former head start children   From a database generated by the multi-site National Head Start/Public School Early Childhood Transition Demonstrated Project, a subsample of the 154 children with the highest academic achievement was drawn from the 5,142 non-handicapped participants from English-speaking homes with relatively complete data collected in Spring of first grade. Their families reported higher educational and income levels and had fewer children, more of the families were Caucasian, children's caretakers less often reported prolonged depression, parenting practices were more responsive and flexible and less restrictive, and the children were seen by parents and teachers as more socially skilled than were the comparison group. Within this low-income group (half reporting monthly incomes of $1000 or less), conditions propitious for child development are demonstrated to be associated with high academic competence."
616,1998.0,Gender-related differences in academically talented students' scores and use of time on tests of spatial ability,"Gender-related differences in academically talented students' scores and use of time on tests of spatial ability   Gender-related differences in test scores of spatial ability have been ascribed to a tendency of females to take more time in working on such tasks, which is believed to be to their disadvantage in time-limited tests. This hypothesis was examined in a population of academically talented students who took four subtests on the computer of the Spatial Test Battery of the Institute for the Academic Advancement of Youth. Males had higher scores on three of these tests, females on another test which was a measure of visual memory. Females tended to take more time to work on the tests, even when their scores were higher than those of males, but this difference was substantial only for two of the tests. the time taken to work on the items was positively correlated with the scores on two of the tests. These results indicate that the amount of time taken can neither explain gender-related score differences on spatial tests in general is the habit to use more time necessarily detrimental to test performance. The habit to work quickly or slowly on spatial tests appeared to be a fairly general characteristic. It seems to be different from speed of cognitive processing. When asked to give ratings on their performance on the tests, females tended to estimate their scores more modestly than males, although females, like males, tended to overestimate their performance on two of the measures."
617,1998.0,Building bridges between general practitioners and educators of the gifted: A study of collaboration,"Building bridges between general practitioners and educators of the gifted: A study of collaboration   The Collaboration Research Study examined the incidence of collaboration, as well as the assumptions of those who entered collaborative alliances. Collaboration was defined as dialogue and planning between professionals in which the goal is to provide differentiated services for high achieving students. Two hundred and eighty-nine enrichment specialists, classroom teachers, and administrators, selected purposefully, took part in this national , descriptive, ex post facto research. The response rate from the three groups was 61%, 55%, and 51%, respectively. Results indicate that more than 80% of those sampled engage in collaboration. Data suggest that classroom teachers and enrichment specialists enter the collaborative relationship with different, and sometimes conflicting, sets of assumptions about the skills and attitudes of their collaborative partners. These empirical findings suggest that collaboration is a complex, interpersonal process. Implications of the study are twofold. First, collaboration depends upon highly developed interpersonal skills. Second, successful collaborative relationships rest upon the match between the assumptions that each party holds about the other. In order to ensure collaborative alliances that can produce high quality, differentiated learning options, the assumptions of each party need to be understood and, if necessary, bridges need to be built when gaps exist between the assumptions and the actual skills and attitudes of collaborative parties."

Navigation along three interpretive dimensions can clarify and expand these conceptual foundations, which currently suffer from fragmentation and insularity. One of these dimensions invites movement through several different world views Another dimension invites interdisciplinary movement from the precision of the hard sciences to the uncertain complexity of the soft and human sciences. A third dimension promotes movement through different levels of analysis, ranging from panoramic levels of philosophical and theoretical perspectives to the grounded levels of empirical research and practical application. A three-dimensional model illustrates the dynamics of these movements while highlighting some barriers that cause fragmentation and insularity in conceptual foundations. Recommendations for breaking through these barriers are provided."
622,1998.0,A proposal for subcategories within gifted or talented populations,"A proposal for subcategories within gifted or talented populations   Following a survey of the literature and a critique of an earlier proposal by Gagne (1993), the author describes a new system of categories to subdivide the gifted and talented populations into more homogeneous subgroups. Based on the metric system, each of the five levels, including the minimum threshold, selects the top 10% of the previous level; to each subgroup is attributed a qualify label: mild, moderate, high, exceptional, extreme. The author argues for its widespread adoption by professionals in the field of gifted education."
623,1998.0,"Gifted students with attention deficits: Fact and/or fiction? Or, can we see the forest for the trees?","Gifted students with attention deficits: Fact and/or fiction? Or, can we see the forest for the trees?   According to Gordon (1990), far too many high ability students are referred for problems with impulsivity, hyperactivity, and sustaining attention. Several important issues, rarely discussed in the literature on attention deficits, offer alternative hypotheses for the increasing incidence of hyper-activity and attention problems of gifted youngsters. These include theories on emotional development and excitability of gifted students (Dabrowski, 1938; Piechowski & Colangelo, 1984), evidence of unchallenging curricula for high ability students (Reif, 1993), implications of the multiple intelligences paradigm (Gardner, 1983), and adult reaction to students' extreme precocity (Rimm, 1994). These issues are examined in light of Barkley's theory of inhibition as it relates to the manifestation of ADHD. The issues represent environmental conditions that may cause or influence ADHD-like behaviors in high ability students. Diagnostic and intervention strategies are suggested to counteract environmental contributors to the problem."
624,1998.0,Perceived factors influencing the academic underachievement of talented students of Puerto Rican descent,"Perceived factors influencing the academic underachievement of talented students of Puerto Rican descent   This qualitative investigation explored the self and environmental perceptions of six talented students of Puerto Rican descent who were underachieving in an urban high school in the northeastern section of the United States. Family, school, classroom, community, and personality issues were examined, as were the ways that these experiences contributed to their actual academic status. Participant observation, interviews, document review, and other supplementary techniques were used to gather data. The major findings of this study was that the absence of early appropriate academic experiences thwarted students' possibilities of developing their high abilities or talents later in life. Other interactive factors influencing the students' academic life were also identified. A model explaining the phenomenon of underachievement among the students emerged, as did suggestions for meeting their needs."
625,1998.0,Curriculum compacting and achievement test scores: What does the research say?,"Curriculum compacting and achievement test scores: What does the research say?   This study examined the effects of curriculum compacting on the achievement test scores of a national sample of 336 high ability students from second through sixth grade heterogeneous classrooms in rural, suburban, and urban settings. Curriculum compacting is a strategy for eliminating curricular material that students have already mastered and replacing it with more appropriate learning activities. Teachers from three treatment and control groups in this experimental study selected one to two students from their classes who demonstrated superior ability and advanced content knowledge prior to instruction. They were able to eliminate between 40%-50% of curricula for these students across content areas. Pre and post student achievement was examined using the Iowa Test of Basic Skills, and out-of-grade-level (one grade higher) tests were used to guard against ceiling effects. The results indicated that the achievement test scores of the students whose curriculum was compacted did not differ significantly from students whose curriculum was not compacted. These findings from a national study minimize teachers' fears about declines in students' achievement test scores due to compacting."

We explored three simple models of factors contributing to underachievement as well as a complex model incorporating all three factors. The complex model provided the best fit for the data, yet each of the three simple models was significant, suggesting the importance of an ecological approach to problems of underachievement among gifted students. intervention approaches deriving from each model were discussed."
630,1998.0,Concepts of mental activities and verbs in children of high and average verbal intelligence,"Concepts of mental activities and verbs in children of high and average verbal intelligence   In order to understand the contribution of increased cognitive abilities to children's naive theories of mind, children of high and average verbal intelligence rated their understanding of the interrelationships between and among mental activities and verbs. In Study 1, participants rated the similarity of pairs of prototypical mental activity scenarios according to the way you use your mind in each one. The scenarios represented the categories of list memory, prospective memory, comprehension, selective attention, inference, planning, comparison, and recognition. In Study 2, participants cited the similarity of cognitive and affective verbs (e.g. decide, memorize, love, worry). Multidimensional scaling and clustering analyses indicated very similar organization and structure of concepts in children of high and average verbal intelligence in both studies. These results add to the growing body of literature suggesting that metacognitive development and its association with intelligence differ depending on the type of metacognition being examined (Alexander, Carr & Schwanenflugel, 1995)."
631,1998.0,Birth-order effects in the academically talented,"Birth-order effects in the academically talented   Birth-order position was studied among 828 academically talented students from a national sample collected by the Institute for the Academic Advancement of Youth of Johns Hopkins University. When compared to 1990 U.S. Census Bureau data, this sample was disproportionately composed of first-born students. However, much of this birth order effect can be explained by the covariate of family size, with small families overrepresented among the gifted. First-born students tended to get higher verbal scores on the secondary School Admissions Test while youngest-born tended to do better in math. Students were administered the Rotter Internal-External Locus of Control Scale, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, the Multidimensional perfectionism Scale, the Adjective Check List, the NEO Five Factor inventory, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, and the Brief Symptom Inventory. Except for a mild relationship between birth order and perfectionistic type, there was no relationship found between birth-order position and personality and adjustment. It is believed that often reported birth-order position effects are strongly related to the covariance of family size."
632,1998.0,Gender differences in teacher and student perceptions of gifted students' ability and effort,"Gender differences in teacher and student perceptions of gifted students' ability and effort   This study investigated whether female gifted students viewed the quality and importance of their work, effort, and ability differently than male gifted students. The study also investigated whether teachers perceived male and female students differently with respect to these areas in mathematics, language arts, social studies, and science. The sample included 5,385 fourth through eighth grade students who were identified as gifted and talented by their teachers. Teachers consistently rated females higher than males on effort and the quality of their work. Teachers rated males and females similarly on all abilities except language arts in which they rated females higher. Female students rated their language arts ability higher than males while the males rated their mathematics, science, and social studies abilities higher. The correlation between ratings of students' ability and quality of work and ratings of students' effort and quality or work were significantly different for students and teachers."

A total of 3,532 students from 45 school districts in 24 states completed surveys designed to assess their interest in creating a variety of products. Factor analytic procedures yielded 11 factors with alpha reliabilities ranging from 72 to 95. The analysis allowed examination of the content and construct validity for the instrument. The article concludes with practical classroom applications for the expression style inventory in talent development programs such as those based on the Schoolwide enrichment Model (Renzulli & Reis, 1985)."

Mothers' attitudes toward independence and strictness, their concerns, and support network variables (i.e., perceived helpfulness of the network, willingness to seek help from the network, and the amount of contact the child had with network members) were found to be significantly related to multiple dimensions of children's perceived competence.

640,1997.0,Developmental changes in mathematically precocious young children: Longitudinal and gender effects,"Developmental changes in mathematically precocious young children: Longitudinal and gender effects   Young children with advanced mathematical skill (N = 276) were followed for two years, during kindergarten through 1st grade or 1st through 2nd grade. Children were randomly assigned to an intervention condition reflecting a constructivist approach or a control condition. Mean scores for the control group on standardized math, verbal, and visual-spatial measures increased or remained the same. Boys gained more than girls on the quantitative and visual-spatial measures. The treatment group made greater gains than the control group on quantitative measures only. Gender did not interact with treatment condition. Correlations among the quantitative, verbal, and visual-spatial factors remained stable for control children, but the correlation between quantitative and verbal factors increased for the intervention group."
641,1997.0,Cooperative learning environments: Effects on academic attitudes of gifted students,"Cooperative learning environments: Effects on academic attitudes of gifted students   The attitudes of academically gifted students and the general cohort toward cooperative learning and academic school subjects were studied. Three hypotheses were tested: (a) in classes where cooperative learning is used, nonidentified children will exhibit mole positive attitudes toward cooperative learning methods than their more academically able peers; (b) boys will exhibit more positive attitudes toward cooperative learning than girls; (c) Gifted children, in contrast to non-gifted peers, will exhibit more positive attitudes in settings where cooperative learning is seldom or never used than in settings where such instruction is frequently used. Data obtained from 28 classes of sixth-, seventh-, and eighth-graders in four schools generally supported hypotheses (a) and (b), but not (c). Although not a strong finding, overall attitudes toward school subjects were most positive in classes where cooperative learning was used sparingly as an instructional supplement."

Women who perceived their husbands as supportive believed they had highpotential for achievement, in part, because of the husband's support, the couple's commitment to joint family goals, and willingness to share domestic chores. Women who perceived their husbands occasionally supportive, felt free to achieve occasionally. These women reported that greater levels of achievement were possible if they confronted their husband through negotiation or if they developed talents that contributed to the family's income. Women felt they had low potential for achievement if they had an unsupportive spouse or worked solely for financial gain."

These characteristics were displayed in gifted children through 5 overexcitabilities: psychomotor, sensual, intellectual, imaginational, and emotional. This theory was investigated using a qualitative case study methodology Data were collected on 5 young gifted children (ages 4 through 6) and analyzed using Dabrowski's 5 overexcitabilities as a theoretical framework. Results displayed that the 5 overexcitabilities were manifested in the children through behaviors in the classroom and at home. Results support the use of Dabrowski's theory in identifying and understanding some aspects of the behavior of young gifted children."
647,1997.0,"Early identification of gifted minority kindergarten students in Newark, NJ","Early identification of gifted minority kindergarten students in Newark, NJ   The overall objective of the ''Minority Gifted Children'' project is to promote the cognitive and educational development of kindergarten through second grade economically disadvantaged minority gifted children from Newark, New Jersey. Prior to the inception of this project, no Newark public schools provided gifted services for kindergarten students, and the programs for first and second graders were serving a disproportionately small number of children. The current report presents data on a screening and assessment procedure being developed to identify gifted inner city minority kindergarten students. Before the project began, only 0.2% of children entering first grade were identified as gifted, in contrast to the 2% found in this sample. The method of identification used in this project appears to hold promise as a relatively cost efficient method of finding young minority children who are gifted in cognitive skill areas. This work indicates that young inner city minority gifted children exist. Therefore, it is imperative that education programs be provided to nurture potential excellence and achievement in this population."
648,1997.0,The self-concept of gifted adolescents in a congregated program,"The self-concept of gifted adolescents in a congregated program   A positive self-concept is one of the most important forces driving a student to achieve. This study employed a combination of the Harter Self Perception profile for Adolescents (SPPA), used over time, and an interview technique to study 25 gifted adolescents during the transition year in a congregated (grouped) classroom for high-ability students in secondary school. The self-image of the students increased significantly in the subscales of Romantic Appeal and Close Friendship. There was also an interact-ion of time by gender on Behavioral Conduct. Changes in importance ratings also occurred with significant interactions of time by gender on Scholastic Competence, Behavioral Conduct, and Close Friendship. The interviews revealed that gifted students enjoyed being with their gifted peers, however, that they were conscious of being labelled as different. The descriptive study provides insights into the self-concept of students in a congregated (grouped) program."

As girls, those who became eminent scientists were much more like, rather than different from, other girls who became eminent. All girls were, for example, precocious and hard working. In early life, however young scientists did exhibit several distinguishing traits from girls who became eminent in other fields. They were more concentrated on science and engaged in scientific activities; they were also more bookish and scholarly Many lived in rural areas and were allowed or encouraged to pursue nature study, reading, and writing. Case studies of two women scientists exemplify early traits and opportunities that distinguish girls who became eminent women scientists."
650,1997.0,Perennial debates and tacit assumptions in the education of gifted children,"Perennial debates and tacit assumptions in the education of gifted children   For many years, educators of the gifted have debated topics central to the field such as definition, identification, and curriculum (Getzels & Dillon, 1973). This paper explores the possible relationships between gifted educators' periodic debates and the philosophical war among advocates of differing perspectives of social science research. The authors discuss how the acceptance of a particular mode of inquiry embeds tacit ideas into the debate that make resolution difficult. The tacit assumptions of three modes of disciplined inquiry (empirical-analytic, interpretive, and transformative) are presented in conjunction with the accompanying reformulation and reconceptualization of issues (definition, identification, and curriculum) that occur with each mode of inquiry."

Project START, a university/school district collaboration, identified and served high-potential, low-income and/or minority, primary age students based on multiple intelligence theory. Instructional and programmatic interventions also included multicultural emphases, language immersion, use of manipulatives, participation in mentorships, and a family outreach program. This article reports findings from eight case studies of START learners, and provides insights into factors that promoted success and discouraged success for these learners, both in the regular classroom and in transition to special services for gifted learners."
657,1997.0,An analysis of teacher nominations and student performance in gifted programs,"An analysis of teacher nominations and student performance in gifted programs   This study evaluated the relationship of teacher nomination instruments to later performance of students in a gifted program. Teacher nominations were based on two instruments, an instrument designed specifically to assess gifted behaviors of students from culturally divergent and/or low income populations and an instrument designed to assess gifted behaviors in the general population. Separate canonical correlation analyses between these two instruments and a gifted teacher rating of student performance resulted in significant findings indicating relationships between the teacher nominations and later school performance. Structure correlations showed nominations based on thinking abilities, general gifted behaviors, and special learning skills were related to later performance on creativity, group skills, and language abilities."
658,1997.0,Metacognitive knowledge of gifted children and nonidentified children in early elementary school,"Metacognitive knowledge of gifted children and nonidentified children in early elementary school   The study compared the declarative metacognitive knowledge of 22 gifted and 40 general cohort kindergarten and first grade children. Children were given a metacognitive interview questionnaire examining their understanding of variables related to memory and attention. Gifted children were superior to the general cohort for only 18% of the memory and 12% of the attention questions. Collapsing across all the questions, however, the gifted showed significantly higher general metacognitive knowledge. Greater metacognitive knowledge in gifted children emerges by early elementary school, particularly for metacognitive attributions."
659,1997.0,Expanding Lazarus and Folkman's paradigm to the social and emotional adjustment of gifted children and adolescents (SEAM),"Expanding Lazarus and Folkman's paradigm to the social and emotional adjustment of gifted children and adolescents (SEAM)   A qualitative study of how 20 gifted children and adolescents cope with demands and pressures they experience is the basis of the model of social and emotional adjustment presented in this article. The model combines patterns in the ways the children and adolescents responded to the stressors in their lives with theoretical and empirical information from the fields of child development and personal adjustment to stress. Intrapersonal, family, school, and peer influences, as well as functional and dysfunctional patterns of social and emotional adjustment, are explained within the framework of the model."
660,1997.0,Intellectual contributions and mutual support among developmentally advanced children in homogeneous and heterogeneous work/discussion groups,"Intellectual contributions and mutual support among developmentally advanced children in homogeneous and heterogeneous work/discussion groups   To investigate previous claims that close association among gifted children provides them with the intellectual stimulation and socioaffective support they need, 32 eighth grade students (18 males and 14 females), divided according to their educational program placement, were observed working on various tasks in either homogeneous or heterogeneous ability groups. Homogeneously congregated gifted children in a self-contained program exchanged constructive types of knowledge and prosocial feedback significantly more frequently than either homogeneously grouped nonidentified students or heterogeneously mixed gifted and nonidentified youth. Gifted children within the mixed group tended to congregate among themselves; they varied widely in the frequency and nature of their interactions with nonidentified group mates."

662,1997.0,Rethinking multipotentiality among the intellectually gifted: A critical review and recommendations,"Rethinking multipotentiality among the intellectually gifted: A critical review and recommendations   This paper critically reviews the concept of multipotentiality as it has been defined and encountered in the scientific literature on gifted children. Until recently, it has bot been adequately subjected to empirical evaluation. Despite its ubiquitous presence in the literature, several pieces of evidence are presented suggesting that multipotentiality has been erroneously interpreted and falsely assumed to apply to a majority of intellecutually gifted individuals. Findings are summarized from a recent report (Achter, Lunbinski, & Benbow, 1996) on the ability interest, and value profiles of over 1000 students from the Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth (SMPY), as well as evidence compiled from other empirical studies, indicating that above-level assessment of abilities and preferences among gifted adolescents reveal markedly differentiated profiles for the vast majority (over 95% when all factors were consulted). Thus, the concept of multipotentiality requires rethinking. Traditional assessment tools found in vocational psychology (i.e., questionnaires. and tests measuring abilities, interests, and values), when offered in an above-level format, are useful in serving the educational and career counseling needs of intellectually gifted young adolescents. Further, such tools are helpful for gaining an appreciation of the diversity of individual differences among the intellectually talented."
663,1997.0,Specialized counseling services for gifted youth and their families: A needs assessment,"Specialized counseling services for gifted youth and their families: A needs assessment   Although many authors have recommended counseling for the gifted (Colangelo, 1991; Kerr; 1986; Silverman, 1993b), little research has been done to find out what types of counseling services parents, teachers, and counseling professionals believe to be most beneficial to the development of gifted and talented individuals (Myers & Pace, 1986; Passow 1991; Shore, Cornell, Robinson, & Ward, 1991). In this study 335 patients, school personnel, and related counseling professionals were surveyed to determine their perceptions of the specialized counseling needs of gifted children and adolescents as part of a needs assessment for a proposed university-based counseling center. Results indicated that all groups of respondents believed that gifted and talented youth have important social, emotional, family, and talent and career development needs that can best be met by differentiated counseling services; and that such services are not readily available to gifted youth. Implications of the study for the development of counseling services and the training of counseling professionals are discussed."
664,1997.0,Differences in EEG alpha activity between gifted and non-identified individuals: Insights into problem solving,"Differences in EEG alpha activity between gifted and non-identified individuals: Insights into problem solving   The study investigated differences in electroencephalography (EEG) alpha activity between gifted and non-identified students. Seventeen gifted and 17 non-identified students. participated in the experiment. Their EEG was recorded while they solved four problems. Two measures were used: 1) an asymmetry index or differences in hemispheric activity and 2) the overall difference between a relaxed mental state and problem solving. The findings can be summarized as follows: First, gifted students in a relaxed mental condition showed greater left hemispheric activation than did non-identified students. In contrast, during problem,solving, non-identified students showed greater left hemispheric activity than did gifted students. Second, gifted students exhibited a higher overall hemispheric activation in a relaxed mental state and exploring the problem, and a lower activation when problem solving was involved, than did non-identified students."
665,1997.0,I don't want to sit in the corner cutting out valentines: Leadership roles for teachers of talented art students,"I don't want to sit in the corner cutting out valentines: Leadership roles for teachers of talented art students   Two research studies which focus on the process and results of educating teachers of high ability visual arts students to take leadership roles in their schools communities, and beyond are presented. One study involved focus groups of 1994 participants in the Artistically Talented Program (ATP) at Indiana University; the other included a survey sent to all teachers who participated in ATP from 1991 to 1995. A framework based on a content analysis of the data in these two studies has applicability to other inservice education programs for teachers of talented art students. Knowledge of subject matter content, pedagogy, building self-esteem, and allowing choices can lead teachers of artistically talented students, who have leadership potential, to collaborate with others. Teachers can become empowered to make changes in their private and professional lives that eventually result in communities of caring professionals able to assume leadership roles."
666,1997.0,A multi-site case study of successful classroom practices for high ability students,"A multi-site case study of successful classroom practices for high ability students   A multi-site case study was conducted to describe 10 elementary schools and classrooms with a reputation for implementing differentiated practices to meet the needs of high ability students. The researchers found that classroom teachers at some sites employed flexible grouping practices or provided opportunities for advanced level projects to accommodate students' differing academic needs. At other sites, teachers collaborated with other teachers at their grade level or with district curriculum specialists to provide more academic challenge for talented students. And in some situations, the leadership of school principals or superintendents appeared to have a strong impact on teachers' instructional practices. The themes that emerged across the sites include: (a) teachers' advanced knowledge and training, (b) teachers' willingness and readiness to embrace change, (c) collaboration, (d) teachers' beliefs and strategies for differentiating the curriculum, (e) leadership, and (f) autonomy and support."

671,1996.0,A longitudinal study of academic intrinsic motivation in intellectually gifted children: Childhood through early adolescence,"A longitudinal study of academic intrinsic motivation in intellectually gifted children: Childhood through early adolescence   Academic intrinsic motivation of intellectually gifted children and a comparison group was examined in the Fullerton Longitudinal Study. Children at ages 9 through 13 years were administered the Children's Academic Intrinsic Motivation Inventory which assesses intrinsic motivation for school learning in reading, math, social studies, science, and for school in general. Analyses showed that across the ages, relative to a peer comparison, gifted children had significantly higher academic intrinsic motivation across all subject areas and school in general. It is suggested that: Children who become intellectually gifted enjoy the process of learning to a greater extent; intrinsic motivation is important for potentiation of giftedness; Assessment of academic intrinsic motivation be included in selection of children for gifted programs."
672,1996.0,Motivational orientations and metacognitive abilities of intellectually gifted students,"Motivational orientations and metacognitive abilities of intellectually gifted students   The study compared the motivational orientations (beliefs about the causes far school successes and failures and self-perceptions of competence) and metacognitive abilities (knowledge and reported use of learning and reading strategies) of 143 Grade 7 intellectually gifted students from a selective high school in Australia with 133 average-achieving age peers from comprehensive schools. Results revealed a general pattern of the gifted sample perceiving themselves to be cognitively more competent, thus less likely to attribute failures to lack of ability. In comparison with average-achieving peers, gifted students had greater confidence in their own personal control over successes or failures in school tasks (control over the amount of effort to put in and in the use of strategies), demonstrated more knowledge of learning strategies, and achieved higher levels of reading competence. The findings also revealed different patterns of relations:hips among motivation, metacognition, and academic competence for gifted students and the general cohort."
673,1996.0,The incidence of perfectionism in gifted students,"The incidence of perfectionism in gifted students   Using the Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale (Frost et al., 1990) perfectionism scores were compared between a group of 600 students identified as academically talented and a group of 418 peers from the general cohort. In this nationally gathered sample, all students were sixth graders and of similar socioeconomic status. Findings indicated little difference between the mean scores of the two groups. Comparisons were also made between the gifted students and the general cohort using an empirical typology of perfectionism. This analysis did not indicate a statistically significant difference in the frequency of perfectionistic types between gifted students and the general cohort. These findings suggest that the frequent anecdotal reports of greater perfectionism among the gifted may be a product of differential labeling patterns of similar behaviors when demonstrated by gifted students and the general cohort. A greater distinction between perfectionistic striving's which stimulate excellence and those perfectionistic strivings which frustrate and inhibit achievement needs to be made."
674,1996.0,Gender differences in mathematics and the sciences: Can attributional retraining improve the performance of gifted females?,"Gender differences in mathematics and the sciences: Can attributional retraining improve the performance of gifted females?   There are probably no subject areas in which the problem of reducing gender differences is as urgent as in mathematics and the ha;rd sciences. In this article, we provide a topical overview of the participation rates of girls and women in schools and. universities, an emphasis on the situation in Germany. We then discuss several attempts to explain these differences and show that until recently not enough attention has been paid to the girls' and women's self-related cognitions in these domains. They underestimate their own talents in mathematics and the sciences and, from a motivational perspective, attribute their successes and failures in such a way as to further inhibit motivation. Attributional retraining techniques could provide a solution to the problems of lowered motivation and performance. These retraining techniques have proved successful in clinical and laboratory settings, but they have not been tried in natural settings like schools and universities. Following an overview of the most important attributional retraining techniques, we describe two studies carried out with German high school students in mathematics and with female university students in statistics. Using an attributional retraining technique we developed, both studies report extremely promising results. Finally, on the basis of these studies, suggestions for further research are made."
675,1996.0,"Gifted and non-selected children's perceptions of academic achievement, academic effort, and athleticism","Gifted and non-selected children's perceptions of academic achievement, academic effort, and athleticism   The purpose of the study was to examine gifted and non-selected children's perceptions of academic achievement, academic effort, and athleticism. 62 gifted and 61 non-selected 8 to 14-year-old children rated a series of hypothetical male and female characters differing in the aforementioned traits, Repeated-measures ANOVAs indicated that academic achievement and athleticism were important determinants of a character's acceptance, but that academic effort was not. We hypothesized that gifted children would view brilliant and studious characters more positively than would non-selected children. Gifted and non-selected children did not differ in their perceptions of studious characters, but marginal support was revealed for the contention that gifted children would be more accepting of brilliant characters than would non-selected children."
676,1996.0,"Research on motivation and the gifted: Implications for identification, programming, and evaluation","Research on motivation and the gifted: Implications for identification, programming, and evaluation   Much research on motivation and the gifted has tended to look at motivational characteristics of the gifted, either describing sti?dents in terms of their type or level of motivation, or comparing gifted students to others. Other research on this topic considers motivation as an outcome measure of programs or curricula for the gifted, for example determining if program participation increases student interest in a particular field. The former body of research may have the most practical use for understanding and identifications,for instructional strategy decisions and for program evaluation."

680,1996.0,Using the Purdue three-stage model to facilitate local program evaluations,"Using the Purdue three-stage model to facilitate local program evaluations   Program evaluations conducted by district staff for the purpose of providing feedback to local decision makers are necessary for program improvement and accountability (Fetterman, 1993) and can facilitate the creation of longitudinal data bases on the outcomes of gifted and talented programs. This research and development project was undertaken to design, implement, and evaluate a year-long staff development program to improve the evaluation skills of the participants. The Purdue Three-Stage Model (Feldhusen & Kolloff, 1978; Moon, 1994) was used as the theoretical framework for the training program developed. Results suggest that the self-evaluation training was effective in helping coordinators become more skilled program evaluators. Implications of the project for program evaluation, training of program administrators, and longitudinal research on the outcomes of gifted and talented programs are discussed."
681,1996.0,"Identification, instruction and assessment of gifted children: A construct validation of a triarchic model","Identification, instruction and assessment of gifted children: A construct validation of a triarchic model   This article presents a unified model - the triarchic theory of human intelligence - for the identification, instruction, and assessment of the achievement of gifted children. The article opens with a discussion of the need for a unified model of identification, instruction, and assessment. The triarchic model is then offered as one potential model. Next the article discusses how the triarchic model could be implemented in a variety of subject matter areas. Finally, it describes a construct-validation of the model in the context of one subject matter area, college-level psychology taught to high-school students. The results show promise for the models use in gifted education. Students performed better when their triarchic ability pattern was matched, rather than mismatched to instruction and assessment."
682,1996.0,"Assessment of leadership in children, youth and adults","Assessment of leadership in children, youth and adults   Current theories of leadership are reviewed, Eleven leadership measures, six for children and youth and five for adults, are reviewed in the context of these theories and with psychometric standards for test use. In general, the measures are normed inadequately and lack information about reliability and validity. The use of short subscales embedded within other scales, which themselves often are inadequate, should be avoided. Currently, we lack the assessment technology to measure leadership adequately in children and youth. Leadership measures for adults are more promising, especially the Leadership Opinion Questionnaire, the Supervisory Behavior Description Questionnaire, and the Campbell Leadership Index."
683,1996.0,Identifying cognitively gifted ethnic minority children,"Identifying cognitively gifted ethnic minority children   Four hundred kindergarten children in regular education and 31 kindergarten children identified as gifted were presented a cognitive battery consisting of nine different tasks. Five measures representing the three open-ended tasks were associated with both a significant group difference and the presence of high performing outliers from the regular education sample. When frequency distributions for the two groups were computed based on a total score summed over the five measures, seven of the eight regular education students with the highest score, the upper 2%, were either Black/NonHispanic or White/Hispanic. The upper 2% of the regular education sample performed at a level above 81% of the gifted sample. The data suggest that using a child's performance on a cognitive battery may prove to be effective for identifying gifted minority children who have not previously been identified as having superior cognitive abilities."

Examples of assessment initiatives grounded in models of excellent performance are also summarized."
692,1996.0,A fraction is not a piece of pie: Assessing exceptional performance and deep understanding in elementary school mathematics,"A fraction is not a piece of pie: Assessing exceptional performance and deep understanding in elementary school mathematics   The purpose of this study was to investigate how exceptional performance representing deep understanding of mathematical concepts might be assessed in the classroom or in larger scale assessment contexts. The study focused on several types of assessment based on cognitive analysis of fractions: problem solving, justification, and explanation tasks. Additional assessments, including propositional and procedural knowledge measures, provided validation data. Data were collected from 540 fifth grade students. To score at the highest levels, students had to show that they understood that fractions are numbers that can express relations between quantities, or at least that they had taken major steps toward such a conceptualization. Overall, student performance was consistent with that obtained in many other research and assessment studies. Fewer than 10% of the students performed adequately on the explanation task. More than 60% of the students failed to express any fraction principle or concept in their explanations, and 54% expressed serious misconceptions. A small number of students, however, displayed exceptional understanding. The effective-additional reason for optimism: students who received seven days of instruction on fractions in measurement contexts performed better on the explanation task than students who received traditional part-whole instruction. This result, in addition tasks were strongly associated with the expression of conceptual or principled knowledge in explanations, supported the use of the explanation task to assess understanding of concepts and principles."
693,1996.0,"Wherefore art thou, multiple intelligences? Alternative assessments for identifying talent in ethnically diverse and low income students","Wherefore art thou, multiple intelligences? Alternative assessments for identifying talent in ethnically diverse and low income students   The recent popularity of Multiple Intelligences (MI) theory corresponds with current efforts to move away from the use of standardized measures of achievement and ability to more authentic assessment techniques, including portfolio and performance-based assessment. Gardner and his colleagues have strongly encouraged the application of MI theory to performance-based assessment. This study investigates the reliability and validity of a battery of instruments based on MI theory, including teacher checklists and performance-based assessment activities. The purpose in developing the instruments was the identification of talent in culturally diverse and/or low income kindergarten and first grade students. Results suggest acceptable evidence of reliability but raise questions about the validity of the assessments. This study has implications for both future research efforts and the application of MI-based, performance measures to the assessment and identification of talent."

The approach was designed to recognize previously overlooked abilities in urban elementary students, including low income, bilingual, and special education students. The TII observation process was designed to evoke artful behaviors that can be readily recognized by arts specialists and classroom teachers. We found strong agreement among raters and adequate stability estimates. Evidence for validity was obtained through factor analysis and a variety of construct validity procedures. The performance-based assessment described here may have implications for discovering hidden potential in academic as well as artistic domains."

Boys had a higher incidence of perfect scores than girls in Mathematics while more girls than boys had perfect scores in English. There were no significant differences between boys and girls on Reading and Science Reasoning. Comparisons are presented on perfect scorers by gender, ethnicity, and subtest performance. Finally, a profile is provided on the career choices of perfect scorers."

Few studies investigate the behaviors in which high-potential students engage when they are not challenged, and these studies are either of limited focus or do not include middle school students in their sample. Qualitative methodology was used to determine the behaviors and strategies used by 12 high-potential, middle school students when they did not feel challenged in school; teacher reaction to these behaviors was also documented. Data analysis revealed that students engaged in the following behaviors: selective attention, focused curricular involvement, involvement with others, participation in extracurricular activities, and lack of effort/selected effort. Few teachers associated these behaviors with a lack of challenge, and those who recognized the behaviors did not attempt to differentiate the learning process for the students."

No effect of gender or program was found for sex-role orientation or global self-concept. Analysis of domain-specific aspects of self-concept, however, revealed that gifted students are more anxious and less satisfied with life than regular program students, and that female students are more anxious but better behaved than male students. Individuals with an undifferentiated sex-role orientation were found to core lowest on global self-concept and certain domain-specific aspects of self-concept, especially in comparision with masculine and androgynous individuals. Finally, the relationship between sex-role orientation and self-concept (general as well as domain-specific) was found to be consistent across program and gender."
702,1996.0,Should self-nominations be allowed in peer nomination forms?,"Should self-nominations be allowed in peer nomination forms?   The present study addressed the problem of slef-nominations in peer nomination forms (PNF) used with children to designate classroom peers who have superior abilities or talents. Its goal was to assess the incidence and worth of that information. The sample consisted of 391 students from 17 classes, almost evenly divided by gender and grade (4 to 8). The instrument was a 12-item PNF. Results revealed that self-nominations were very frequent (41%). A repeated measures ANOVA showed that the incidence rate was mainly influenced by the type of ability assessed and the rank of the choices, and that both interacted with the following variables: group, grade level, and gender. Self-nominations had no perceptible impact on the reliability of the talent scores. Self and peer nominations were significantly correlated, z = .44. A much lower correlation was observed between self- and teacher nominations, r = .23, attributed mainly to the lower reliability of these two types of scores."
703,1996.0,The structure of giftedness: The domain of literature as an exemplar,"The structure of giftedness: The domain of literature as an exemplar   The construct validity of the 4 x 4 Structure of Giftedness Model in which giftedness is conceptualized in terms of four categories, i.e., general intellectual ability, specific intellectual ability, general original/creative thinking, and specific creative talent, was investigated in boys and girls in grades 7 to 9 (n = 392) and grades 10 to 12 (n = 381). Students were not limited to those with high IQ scores but rather represented the wide range of abilities and talents postulated by current multidimensional conceptualizations of giftedness. Six alternative models were evaluated and compared with respect to a number of goodness-of-fit indices to determine which model fit the data best. The best fit was the four-factor model, the current hypothesized model of the structure of giftedness in the domain of literature. These results contribute to the conceptual clarification of the diverse abilities that characterize intellectually and creatively gifted individuals, particularly those whose talents lie in the verbal domain."

Although evidence can be presented to support the belief that a fundamental paradigm shift is occurring or has occurred, certain cultural, ethnic, and linguistic minority students continue to be underrepresented in special programs. Research and literature are reviewed to support the thesis that new identification procedures, new curricular and instructional programs, appropriate criteria for evaluating identification procedures, and changes in beliefs and stereotypes are needed to resolve the problem of underrepresentation and to accomplish needed changes. A conceptual framework, definition of giftedness, and an identification process consistent with the definition are discussed. A design for developing appropriate methods and criteria to evaluate identification procedures and for monitoring and evaluating changes in beliefs and stereotypes are provided."

The enrichment program investigated was a pull out program based on the Purdue Three-Stage Model that helped identified gifted and talented elementary children develop creative and critical thinking, problem solving, and independent learning skills (Feldhusen and Kolloff, 1978, 1986). Criterion-based selection procedures were used to select the participants (ten families of high school seniors who had participated in the program for at least three years in elementary school). Data were collected through family interviews, questionnaires, and archival records, and were analyzed by inductive, constant-comparative procedures (Glaser and Strauss, 1967; Goetz and LeCompte, 1984; Strauss and Corbin, 1990) and by data displays (Miles and Huberman, 1994). The findings suggest that, in most cases, the program had a positive influence on both family relationships and home-school relationships."
709,1995.0,IDENTIFYING ACADEMIC POTENTIAL IN STUDENTS FROM UNDER-REPRESENTED POPULATIONS - IS USING THE RAVENS PROGRESSIVE MATRICES A GOOD IDEA,"IDENTIFYING ACADEMIC POTENTIAL IN STUDENTS FROM UNDER-REPRESENTED POPULATIONS - IS USING THE RAVENS PROGRESSIVE MATRICES A GOOD IDEA   Increasing concern has been focused on the under-representation of African-American and Hispanic students in programs for the academically talented. The Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) has been suggested as a possible instrument to help remedy this situation, although little research has been conducted about its viability in identifying academic potential in minority populations. A sample of low-income minority students was given the Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices (APM) along with a more traditional measure of academic aptitude (The School and College Ability Test) to compare the ability of each to identify students who might profit from advanced-level coursework. There were differences among ethnic groups in results of both tests, but a significantly higher proportion of minority children scored at a high level on the RPM than on the traditional measure. In addition, the RPM does appear to be a useful instrument for identifying academic potential in students with limited English proficiency. However, there are still issues and concerns surrounding the use of the APM as the sole instrument for selecting students to participate in special programs stressing high-level academic standards and content. The RPM appears to hold more promise as a general screening instrument to be used in conjunction with other measures to identify students with academic potential who could profit from special programs designed to enhance their academic skills."
710,1995.0,DEPRESSION AND SUICIDAL IDEATION AMONG ACADEMICALLY GIFTED ADOLESCENTS,"DEPRESSION AND SUICIDAL IDEATION AMONG ACADEMICALLY GIFTED ADOLESCENTS   Depression and suicidal ideation among academically gifted adolescents, exceptionally gifted adolescents, and adolescents average in academic performance were examined. No significant differences were detected among the three groups in level, severity, or nature of distress experienced. Results are discussed in light of the supportive interventions appropriate for high school students and the need for further research with subgroups of gifted students more likely to experience psychological distress."
711,1995.0,REVERSING UNDERACHIEVEMENT - CREATIVE PRODUCTIVITY AS A SYSTEMATIC INTERVENTION,"REVERSING UNDERACHIEVEMENT - CREATIVE PRODUCTIVITY AS A SYSTEMATIC INTERVENTION   This study combined qualitative and quantitative methodology in a multiple case study to examine the phenomenon of underachievement and the effect of using creative productivity (Type III) enrichment as a systematic intervention in reversing the pattern. Twelve teachers who received training in the Enrichment Triad Model selected 17 students identified as gifted who were also underachieving in their school performance. The 17 students, ages 8-13, included five girls and twelve boys. All students were guided through a Type III study by their referring teacher during one school year. Questionnaires, interest surveys, interviews, product evaluation, and participant observations provided information about individual students in the context of pursuing Type III investigations. The findings regarding the use of creative productivity to address underachievement were numerous. First, a variety of factors contributed to the underachievement of students with high academic potential including: emotional issues (dysfunctional families); social and behavioral issues (the influence of an inappropriate peer group); the lack of an appropriate curriculum (students not motivated by the regular curriculum); and a suspected learning disability or poor self-regulation. The most compelling finding of this research study was the positive gains made by the students through their involvement in the Type III intervention. Eighty-two percent of the students made positive gains during the course of the year and in the year following the intervention. Most were no longer underachieving in their school settings at the end of the intervention. Five aspects of the process evolved as important foci for different groups of students: 1) the relationship with the teacher; 2) presentation of self-regulation strategies, 3) opportunity to investigate their own issue of underachievement, 4) the opportunity to work on an area of interest in their preferred learning style and 5) the opportunity to interact with an appropriate peer group."
712,1995.0,RELATIONS BETWEEN ACADEMIC APTITUDE AND PSYCHOSOCIAL ADJUSTMENT IN GIFTED PROGRAM STUDENTS,"RELATIONS BETWEEN ACADEMIC APTITUDE AND PSYCHOSOCIAL ADJUSTMENT IN GIFTED PROGRAM STUDENTS   Is high academic aptitude an asset or a liability to psychosocial adjustment among gifted program students? This brief report examined contrasting hypotheses that the relation between academic aptitude and psychosocial adjustment is positive, negative, or curvilinear for high ability students. Robustness of study findings was examined in three diverse groups of gifted program students: 1) 151 second grade students participating in public school gifted programs; 2) 264 5th to 11th grade students attending a university summer enrichment program; and 3) 60 adolescent females enrolled in an early college entrance program. Psychosocial adjustment was assessed by measures of academic, social, and general self-concept in all three groups, with additional adjustment measures specific to each group. Results of hierarchical multiple regression analyses provided little evidence for a relation between aptitude scores and adjustment within this restricted range."

Students then performed free card sorts on these items, which they also rated for application to them. Multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis of students' sorts suggest positive and negative elements of the experience of giftedness along internal and interpersonal dimensions. We conclude with implications of our findings for research and teaching with gifted adolescents."
718,1995.0,CONSEQUENCES OF HAVING A GIFTED SIBLING - MYTHS AND REALITIES,"CONSEQUENCES OF HAVING A GIFTED SIBLING - MYTHS AND REALITIES   Three hundred sixty-six triads, each including a mother and her only two children, ages 7-14, completed questionnaires targeting mental ability and school achievement, child adjustment, and sibling relationship variables. Triads had been chosen as having 0, 1, or 2 children who were eligible for special classes for highly capable students. Except for academic-ability variables, group comparisons according to school-based categories were not suggestive of sibling-giftedness effects. To focus on within-family perceptions, pairs were reclassified using a median split of the first principal component of maternal perceptions of child's giftedness. Contrary to findings of most previous studies, both giftedness and having a gifted sibling were generally associated with more favorable responses by children and mothers. Gender and age effects were also examined."
719,1995.0,THE PARSONAGE CHILDREN - AN ANALYSIS OF THE CREATIVE EARLY YEARS OF THE BRONTES AT HAWORTH,"THE PARSONAGE CHILDREN - AN ANALYSIS OF THE CREATIVE EARLY YEARS OF THE BRONTES AT HAWORTH   This paper analyzes the evolving creative development of the young Brontes at Haworth Parsonage in England during the first half of the nineteenth century. The author concludes that by closely examining the early years of eminent individuals we are better able to analyze those qualities, behaviors, and events that describe the process of talent development. In the case of the Brontes, one is able to study a family of exceptional talent and to reflect on the significance of the role of parents, collaborative siblings, and the natural environment in the nourishing and sustaining of that talent. This paper focuses on the education of the Brontes and on the ''little books'' that they started to produce in abundance when they were young and continued to write into adolescence."
720,1995.0,AN EMPIRICAL-INVESTIGATION OF THE SOCIAL COPING STRATEGIES USED BY GIFTED ADOLESCENTS,"AN EMPIRICAL-INVESTIGATION OF THE SOCIAL COPING STRATEGIES USED BY GIFTED ADOLESCENTS   The formation of an identity during adolescence is believed to be facilitated by conformity to others and membership in a peer group. Because gifted adolescents in a typical school setting often experience difficulties in conformity and peer group membership, they can be expected to face some unique challenges during adolescence. The current study seeks empirical evidence for discrete strategies that gifted adolescents may use to cope with perceived social difficulties. Highly gifted students who were identified by the Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth and who participated in a rigorous summer academic program completed a survey that was specifically designed to reflect coping strategies proposed in the literature. The results of the survey were factor analyzed and yielded five meaningful factors: denial of giftedness, popularity/conformity, peer acceptance, fear of failure, and activity level. The results of the factor analysis suggest that further research focusing on the measurement of social coping strategies among gifted adolescents is warranted."

These women completed a questionnaire about various aspects of their lives including their education and family life; parental encouragement; career, personal, and professional achievements; and the effects of marriage and children on their lives. Follow-up interviews were conducted with 25 of the women. results indicate that the majority of these gifted females believe that their parents encouraged them to go to college but not to pursue a specific career, and many were unsure about whether they had selected the right career. Almost half of the women indicated that barriers existed to their own talent development because of their marriage and personal lives. Many of the women in this study were unsure about whether they were satisfied with their lives because of their continuing attempts to pursue their own talents while maintaining their personal lives. The majority of the women in this study had extremely limited time to pursue their own talents. The study summarizes some of the continuing dilemmas facing gifted females, and in particular, explores some of the issues confronting gifted females who pursue careers, even those generally considered traditional for women."

The author proposes that social context be used as a construct to help rethink how to study the benefits of special environments.

This descriptive ex post facto research, completed in a purposive sample of 19 states, was completed in two phases. Phase 1 included a mail survey to approximately 3,000 local teachers, coordinators, and/or principals who were responsible for programs for students with high abilities. Phase 2 included interviews with key personnel (state directors of gifted education, presidents of state advocacy organizations, school superintendents, chairpersons of local boards) and was designed to triangulate the findings from Phase 1. Results indicated that programs in states with mandates and in good economic health are intact and expanded; programs in all other groups of states (states with mandates and in poor economic health, states without mandates and in good economic health, states without mandates in poor economic health) are being threatened, reduced, and eliminated. More than half of the respondents from states with mandates and in good economic health attributed their expanded or intact status to the mandate and advocacy efforts. About half of the districts from states without mandates attributed their jeopardized status to a decline in state and local funds."

The results indicated a major gulf between the perceptions of mainstream educators and those of educators of the gifted. In the case of middle schools, the disagreement focused on the value of ability grouping and the social consequences of being labeled gifted. In the case of cooperative learning, there were major differences across the board on practically all items. The authors conclude that it is in the interest of all concerned to have more extensive dialogue between educators of the gifted and members of the educational reform movement."
731,1995.0,DECIDING TO DIFFERENTIATE INSTRUCTION IN MIDDLE SCHOOL - ONE SCHOOLS JOURNEY,"DECIDING TO DIFFERENTIATE INSTRUCTION IN MIDDLE SCHOOL - ONE SCHOOLS JOURNEY   As many schools move toward serving a broad range of students in heterogeneous settings, it is important to assist teachers in developing classrooms responsive to the needs of academically diverse learners. Understanding what impedes and what facilitates appropriately differentiated instruction is essential for educational leaders if schools are to move away from one-size-fits-all teaching and if heterogeneous classrooms are to become viable for ''academic outliers'' such as gifted, struggling, and special education learners. This case study examines the experience of one middle school confronted with a district mandate for differentiated instruction and presents the factors which impeded or facilitated their movement toward appropriately differentiated classrooms."

The exposition is divided into five parts. First, we discuss what an implicit theory is and why such theories are important. Second, we describe the pentagonal theory, specifying five conditions claimed to be individually necessary and jointly sufficient for a person to be labeled as gifted. These conditions help us understand not only why some people are labeled as gifted but also why some others are not. Third, we consider the relation of the pentagonal theory to explicit theories of giftedness. Fourth, we present data supporting the theory. Finally, we discuss some implications of the pentagonal theory for gifted education."

Performance of gifted and learning-disabled gifted students exceeded that of the average-performing and learning-disabled students on most measures at both grade levels. A main effect was found for grade; however, secondary average-performing students' performance was closer to that of the gifted and learning-disabled gifted students' performance. Metacognitive performance of the learning-disabled gifted students resembled that of the gifted sample more than that of the learning-disabled sample."

School districts across the nation were asked to supply information on the published instruments they use to measure creativity. Although many school districts include creativity as part of their assessment, they continue to have difficulty with the complex conceptual and operational definitions of creativity. Districts often select instruments for assessment of creativity without attending to the definition of the construct. Researchers are encouraged to improve the translation of their work to the practitioner so that more valid, reliable, and useful assessment will be possible in the schools."

Items in the scale asked the students to indicate their degree of confidence regarding successful completion of everyday mathematics tasks, number sequences, mathematics-based college courses, and mathematics problems. The mean self-efficacy ratings given on the items were analyzed for significant gender differences. Results indicated that males had stronger self-efficacy expectations than females on more than one fourth of the items, whereas females reported stronger self-efficacy expectations on only a few items that involved stereotypical female activities. Implications of the findings for the process of educational decision making are discussed."

To this end, 135 elementary school French-Canadian students (Grade 4 to Grade 6) completed Harter's Intrinsic/Extrinsic Orientation Scale as well as the Cognitive Perceived Competence Scale. Results indicated that gifted students perceived themselves as being more competent and intrinsically motivated toward school activities than regular students. No gender effects were obtained. These results provide support for Deci and Ryan's (1985) cognitive evaluation theory, and the use of this theory in future intrinsic motivation research within the realm of education is recommended."

Their results showed that the gifted adolescents' ''views of their giftedness were not unidimensional'' (p. 245). The purpose of the present study was to further Kerr et al.'s (1988) investigation by tailoring the questions to individuals' experiences and expanding the scoring scheme within response type. Results show that views of the gifted label and its effects are multifaceted, varying in ways different from those previously noted. Gifted adolescents may be coming to realize that there are positive and negative aspects to almost all social roles, statuses, and labels."
752,1994.0,MORE FROM THE WATER JARS - A REANALYSIS OF PROBLEM-SOLVING PERFORMANCE AMONG GIFTED AND NONGIFTED CHILDREN,"MORE FROM THE WATER JARS - A REANALYSIS OF PROBLEM-SOLVING PERFORMANCE AMONG GIFTED AND NONGIFTED CHILDREN   An earlier study of performance on water-jar combination problems concluded that giftedness (defined by superior school performance) is associated with metacognitive strength and flexibility in breaking an induced response set. Breaking sets is useful in bringing new perspectives to problem solving. Water-jar studies traditionally drop children who did not form the set, in this case 40% of the initial sample. The present study reanalyzed the initial data but did not exclude the previously omitted subjects. Gifted subjects who failed to form the set actually made the most errors of any group, and they were more likely not to recognize that they had made these errors. Other children who never formed the set were much like those who did. Therefore, gifted children do not always outperform others on cognitive tasks. There may be motivational reasons for this inferior performance."

Seven central issues regarding educational programs for the gifted are classified according to their basic orientation: (a) level of excellence and the gifted label, (b) types of giftedness, (c) individual versus societal perspectives on the gifted, (d) giftedness in different ethno-cultural backgrounds, (e) origins of giftedness, (f) procedures for identifying and screening the gifted, and (g) effectiveness of educational programs. These issues are either definition oriented (a and b), ideology oriented (c and d), or hypothesis oriented (e, f, and g). It is argued that practitioners and researchers must pay attention to the type of issue being discussed so that discussions and controversies concerning giftedness will be relevant and productive."

They also bring with them mental imprints of what teaching and learning are like, images gained not from their professional preparation programs, but from their years as students. Once in the role of teacher, those views may be reinforced by the circumstances of their apprenticeship. This qualitative study reports five themes in the preservice teaching experience of 10 preservice teachers which may reinforce traditional views of schooling and discourage understanding and addressing unique learning needs of academically diverse learners such as gifted, remedial, and special education learners."

This study showed that teachers trained in gifted education demonstrated greater teaching skills and developed more positive class climates than did teachers who had no training in gifted education. Students of GT trained teachers reported greater emphasis on higher level thinking skills and on discussion, and less emphasis on lecture and grades than did students of untrained teachers."

The author shows that these two concepts are not independent, as usually assumed in studies examining the criterion-related validity of various identification techniques for the gifted and talented. Rather, both are related to the number of subjects singled out as a result of the cutoff value chosen to implement the method. Consequently, most comparisons made between and within methods become invalid. A simple alternative is presented: compare the correlation coefficients of the predictors with the criterion. It is concluded that this methodological flaw, as well as some other technical limitations, invalidates the most often cited observation from that study, namely, that teacher nominations should not be relied upon as an identification technique for the gifted and talented."

Teachers in 20 school districts across the country were randomly assigned by district to one of three treatment groups that received different levels of staff development. After receiving training in curriculum compacting (a procedure that enables teachers to eliminate previously mastered curriculum and substitute more challenging alternatives), teachers were able to eliminate between 42% and 54% of the content for the high-ability students they selected. Teachers in Treatment Group 3, who received the most intensive staff development, completed the highest rated compactor forms. The majority of the teachers in the study were enthusiastic about the process of modifying curriculum for high-ability students, reinforcing Guskey's (1986) model of the process of teacher change."
764,1994.0,A GIFTED CHILDS EDUCATION REQUIRES REAL DIALOG - THE USE OF INTERACTIVE WRITING FOR COLLABORATIVE EDUCATION,"A GIFTED CHILDS EDUCATION REQUIRES REAL DIALOG - THE USE OF INTERACTIVE WRITING FOR COLLABORATIVE EDUCATION   This paper reports the findings of two studies which compared the responses to using dialogue journals by teachers of the gifted and talented and their students. The purpose of this research was to learn more about the ways that such interactive writing can enable GT students to collaborate effectively in their own education. Study 1 sought to determine the types of discourse functions teachers used in the journals they kept with their instructor in a graduate practicum and with the GT students they taught in that practicum. They interacted differently with their instructor than with their students in ways consistent with their role: they commonly used questions, a controlling behavior, when journaling with students. Study 2 examined whether teachers could vary their responses to students' journals to make them more collegial and less controlling. Together these studies supported the use of dialogue journals to promote mutuality in the educational process."
765,1994.0,BEING A TEACHER - EMOTIONS AND OPTIMAL EXPERIENCE WHILE TEACHING GIFTED-CHILDREN,"BEING A TEACHER - EMOTIONS AND OPTIMAL EXPERIENCE WHILE TEACHING GIFTED-CHILDREN   The emotions experienced by teachers while teaching is a relatively unexplored avenue of research. One teacher, Alex, was studied using phenomenological interviews and participant observation to understand the emotions he experienced while teaching in a special program for gifted and talented children. Data were analyzed using inductive procedures. Alex experienced a variety of emotions generated when the instructional dynamics of the lesson were congruent or incongruent with his professional practical knowledge. Most of his emotions were positive. A compelling emotional state, ''being a teacher,'' was found to incorporate many of his feelings and was found repeatedly in his classes. Alex seemed to be trying to recreate being a teacher as he taught. His emotional state was interpreted to be isomorphic to what Csikszentmihalyi (1990) calls ''optimal experience.'' The findings suggest that the special class setting established conditions which increased the probability that Alex would be having an optimal experience."

The project assumed that there are universal identifiers of exceptional potential and that teachers could learn to recognize children with potential in their classrooms if they were provided with authentic examples (videotaped and written) of such behavior. Once identified, curriculum in those classrooms were adapted to meet the children's needs. The teachers expressed a sense of empowerment as a consequence of the project."

Participants in the program included elementary-aged students attending two inner city schools. All pupils at targeted grade levels received instruction over several weeks in order to provide rich opportunities for dynamic assessment by teams of professional artists, arts educators, and specially trained teachers from participating sites. Students identified as a result of the audition processes took part in demanding after school curricula over the course of 3 years. The students' proficiency levels in their respective performing arts were impressive, as was the esteem they gained from teachers, classmates, parents, and from their own disciplined efforts."
773,1994.0,APOGEE - EQUITY IN THE IDENTIFICATION OF GIFTED AND TALENTED STUDENTS,"APOGEE - EQUITY IN THE IDENTIFICATION OF GIFTED AND TALENTED STUDENTS   The Academic Programs for Gifted with Excellence and Equity (APOGEE) serves over 3,000 students in 30 schools in eight school districts. The program was designed to address equity in identification of gifted and talented. The top 25% of students in various categories, such as disadvantaged, minorities, underachievers, limited English speakers, and students with disabilities, are identified and placed in these APOGEE classes. The teachers receive a 45-hour graduate course to train them in implementing a talent development program based on a student-centered curriculum in which choices. group work, projects, and self-regulation are encouraged. Preliminary results indicate significant differences on a pre-post administration of the Cornell Critical Thinking Test and on the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory. The subgroups of the student population are proportionately represented in the program classes."

The philosophical approach of this grant was derived from Gardner's concept of multiple intelligences. The program was designed to involve teachers, parents, district staff, and students in program design and implementation. This article outlines the components of the grant, its operation, and its evaluation as viewed by the author."
775,1994.0,PROMISES TO KEEP - THE STORY OF PROJECT-PROMISE,"PROMISES TO KEEP - THE STORY OF PROJECT-PROMISE   Project Promise, funded under the auspices of the Jacob K. Javits Gifted Students Education Act, was implemented in selected school districts in three states: Arkansas, Kansas, and Missouri. Each state modified the project to fit local needs. Designed to provide leadership opportunities to identified middle school students, especially those from low socioeconomic environments, Project Promise supplemented in-school curricular options with a home visitor. The home visitor's task was to serve as a liaison between students' families and the school. Their role, however, grew in importance as they assisted families in obtaining both social services and information about career and college opportunities. After providing a brief overview of the project, this report more fully explains the role of the home visitor, how school districts modified curriculum to suit student needs, and how the leadership activities affected students in the project."

SEM has been implemented in school districts worldwide, and extensive evaluations and research studies indicate the effectiveness of the model. In this article, a brief explanation of SEM is provided as a summary of the research conducted on this approach. The review of the research is subdivided into (a) the effectiveness of the model as perceived by key groups, (b) research related to creative productivity, (c) research relating to personal and social development, (d) the use of SEM with underserved populations, (e) research on self-efficacy, (f) the use of SEM as a curricular framework, (g) research relating to learning styles and curriculum compacting, and (h) longitudinal research on the SEM, Research suggests that the model is effective at serving high-ability students in a variety of educational settings and in schools that serve diverse ethnic and socioeconomic populations."
780,1994.0,RELATIONSHIPS AMONG PRIVATE SPEECH AND CREATIVITY MEASUREMENTS OF YOUNG-CHILDREN,"RELATIONSHIPS AMONG PRIVATE SPEECH AND CREATIVITY MEASUREMENTS OF YOUNG-CHILDREN   The purpose of this study was to examine relationships among thought processes represented in young children's private speech and creativity assessments of the same children. A secondary purpose was to study the role of affective private speech and its association with creativity measures. The sample was 42 preschool and kindergarten children on whom creativity measures were obtained using the Torrance Thinking Creatively in Action and Movement (TCAM) assessment instrument. Private speech was collected from the same children. Each private speech utterance was coded into one of five levels: (a) task irrelevant speech (T-1); (b) nonfacilitative, task relevant speech (T-2); (c) task relevant speech (T-3); (d) coping/reinforcing speech (T-4); and (e) solving speech (T-5). Statistical analysis revealed significant positive relationships among creativity measures, solving speech, and coping/reinforcing speech. Furthermore, coping and reinforcing private speech were consistently linked with high creativity measures, demonstrating that the affective domain may play a critical role in creative thinking."
781,1994.0,ASSESSING ARTISTIC AND PROBLEM-SOLVING PERFORMANCE IN MINORITY AND NONMINORITY STUDENTS USING A NONTRADITIONAL MULTIDIMENSIONAL APPROACH,"ASSESSING ARTISTIC AND PROBLEM-SOLVING PERFORMANCE IN MINORITY AND NONMINORITY STUDENTS USING A NONTRADITIONAL MULTIDIMENSIONAL APPROACH   The persistent underrepresentation of ethnic minority students in gifted programs requires change. Because identification tools used for entry into gifted programs often are held responsible for minority underrepresentation, this study investigated several nontraditional assessments for their efficacy in identifying both minority and nonminority students. A sample of 433 sixth-grade students responded to a drawing task and to two problem-solving assessments. Peer and teacher nominations also were used in the identification process. Findings indicated that the assessments identified a proportionate number of minority and nonminority students with potential in art or problem solving. The study holds promise for a multidimensional approach and for specific nontraditional assessments as means of effectively identifying both minority and nonminority student talents in art and problem solving. The study also suggests directions for further research."
782,1994.0,CLASSROOM PEER RELATIONS OF CHILDREN PARTICIPATING IN A PULL-OUT ENRICHMENT PROGRAM,"CLASSROOM PEER RELATIONS OF CHILDREN PARTICIPATING IN A PULL-OUT ENRICHMENT PROGRAM   We compared the classroom peer relations of fourth, fifth, and sixth graders participating in a pull-out enrichment program (Creative Learning in a Unique Environment [CLUE]) with all other classmates. Data included peer sociometric assessments, evaluations of friendship relationships, and peer nominations as aggressors and as victims of aggression. Relative to other classmates, CLUE children (a) were evaluated by peers as having greater social acceptability and social competence, (b) demonstrated greater awareness of reciprocity in friendship relationships, and (c) were perceived less often as an aggressor or as a victim of aggression. These children did not have more friends or best friends than their peers, but they had more valued positions within the peer network. These findings suggest that a pull-out enrichment program can be associated with enhanced peer relations in the classroom, an effect not evident in the current research literature."
783,1994.0,LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF AN ENRICHMENT PROGRAM BASED ON THE PURDUE 3-STAGE MODEL,"LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF AN ENRICHMENT PROGRAM BASED ON THE PURDUE 3-STAGE MODEL   The long-term effects of an elementary enrichment program for gifted youth were examined in this retrospective study. The enrichment program investigated was a pull-out program based on the Purdue Three-Stage Model (Feldhusen & Kolloff, 1978, 1986; Feldhusen, Kolloff, Cole, & Moon, 1988; Kolloff & Feldhusen, 1981). Perceptions of students and their families when the students were seniors in high school indicated that the program was successful in achieving its stated goals. The program was also perceived to have had a long-term positive impact on the cognitive, affective, and social development of most participating students and to have been a developmentally appropriate talent development experience. The findings suggest that the Purdue Three-Stage Model is an effective framework for elementary enrichment programs. Implications of the findings for the education of gifted students are discussed."

Three groups were identified: (a) gifted students who entered school early or skipped at least one grade K-7, (b) students enrolled in eighth-grade gifted classes, and (c) regular eighth-grade students. Data were self-reported in the National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS) from the National Center for Educational Statistics (NCES) (Ingels et al., 1989). Results indicated that accelerated students and students in gifted classes had better perceptions of their social relationships and emotional development and tended to have fewer serious school behavior problems than regular students. Contrary to commonly held beliefs, most students who entered school early or skipped elementary grades did not report unusual social isolation or experience profound emotional difficulties. They had serious behavioral problems less frequently than regular students."
790,1993.0,A COMPARISON OF GIFTED UNDERACHIEVERS AND GIFTED HIGH ACHIEVERS,"A COMPARISON OF GIFTED UNDERACHIEVERS AND GIFTED HIGH ACHIEVERS   The purpose of this study was to compare a national sample of gifted underachievers and gifted high achievers on a number of characteristics. Giftedness was measured as a composite score at or above the 95th percentile on the American College Testing Program (ACT). Underachievement was defined as reporting a high school grade-point average of less-than-or-equal-to 2.25 (on a 4.00 scale), and high achievement was defined as reporting a grade-point average of greater-than-or-equal-to 3.75 (on a 4.00 scale). Participants for this study were 30,604 high school juniors and seniors: gifted underachievers n=257: gifted high achievers n=30,347. The underachievers generally had lower scores on the ACT and less extensive out-of-class accomplishments. Over 90% of the underachievers were Caucasian males. Comparisons are provided on a number of nonacademic variables between underachievers and high achievers."
791,1993.0,EDUCATION PATTERNS OF ACADEMICALLY TALENTED YOUTH,"EDUCATION PATTERNS OF ACADEMICALLY TALENTED YOUTH   Students who participated in The Johns Hopkins University Center for Talented Youth Academic Programs are compared to eligible students who did not enroll in CTY courses. The two groups of students. over a 5-year period (1980-1984), were matched on gender and Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores. The results of a questionnaire completed when the last group had finished high school suggest an education pattern of high academic achievement by both groups, with many students pursuing a rigorous high school program including College Board Advanced Placement courses and college courses outside of school. However, students who participated in CTY academic programs reported taking more advanced courses at an earlier age and enrolling in more college courses while in high school than students who did not attend CTY courses. The education pattern and accompanying achievements. exemplified by both groups. provide a validation for the selection instrument. the SAT."
792,1993.0,SUMMER RESIDENTIAL PROGRAMS - ACADEMICS AND BEYOND,"SUMMER RESIDENTIAL PROGRAMS - ACADEMICS AND BEYOND   Every summer, bright students participate in highly challenging residential programs on university campuses. Since many students return year after year, they must be finding something of great value. Although we have confirmation of their academic achievement, little has been done to ascertain the students' own perceptions of the total program experience. This study employed the qualitative research tool of interview and the principles of phenomenology to discern how a group of students saw and interpreted the value of the summer programs. Twelve students who attended Purdue University's residential programs for at least 3 years were interviewed to discover what stood out in their minds as important events during the programs: how they interpreted the effect of the programs on their academic. social, and emotional lives: and what brought them back year after year. A telephone interview was also conducted with a parent of each student to collect their perceptions of the value of the programs for their children. The interviews revealed the importance of summer program experiences for these students. The satisfaction of challenging course work taught by caring. expert teachers and the opportunity to live on a university campus were significant to them: making friends and gaining confidence in their own abilities were equally vital."
793,1993.0,THE EFFECTS OF THE ELIMINATION OF GIFTED AND TALENTED PROGRAMS ON PARTICIPATING STUDENTS AND THEIR PARENTS,"THE EFFECTS OF THE ELIMINATION OF GIFTED AND TALENTED PROGRAMS ON PARTICIPATING STUDENTS AND THEIR PARENTS   Interviews were conducted with 19 parents of students identified and served by a gifted program eliminated in 1990 to determine the effects of the elimination of the program on participants. To triangulate the findings of the interviews, mail surveys were sent to 49 additional parents of students who were also served and identified by the program. Results indicated that parents perceived that their children were experiencing a decline in energy. curiosity, and intrinsic motivation to achieve at high levels and were beginning to disengage from the traditional curriculum. Interviewed parents also reported that the process of program elimination resulted in so much divisiveness that more than half of them had considered alternative educational avenues for their children's remaining years in school."
794,1993.0,CHILD PRODIGIES - A DISTINCTIVE FORM OF GIFTEDNESS,"CHILD PRODIGIES - A DISTINCTIVE FORM OF GIFTEDNESS   The basic premise of this article is that the child prodigy is a distinct form of giftedness which must be understood on its own terms. In contrast with the child of great general ability, the prodigy tends to have a more focused, specialized. and domain-specific form of giftedness. Studies of prodigies have contributed to changing theories about the nature of giftedness (e.g., from single to multiple) and will likely continue to do so. Along with the related phenomenon of savant syndrome. the prodigy points to a set of complex relationships between psychometric intelligence in the traditional sense and expression of talent within specific domains like music or mathematics. Based in part on findings from studies of prodigies. it is likely that there are important roles for both general and specific abilities in most forms of giftedness and that they represent two distinct evolutionary trends to maximize the likelihood of human survival."

First, the role of metacognition in giftedness is explored in the context of current conceptions of giftedness proposed by different theorists. Second, in an attempt to search for empirical evidence linking metacognition to giftedness, various studies of giftedness are reviewed. It is concluded that theoretical and research support is offered for the important role of metacognition in understanding and explaining giftedness. Finally, rather than arguing that the relationship between metacognition and giftedness is clear-cut and conclusive, unresolved issues are discussed and suggestions for future investigations are made."
798,1993.0,CREATIVITY AND INTELLIGENCE IN PRESCHOOLERS,"CREATIVITY AND INTELLIGENCE IN PRESCHOOLERS   This study examined the relationship between creativity and intelligence in preschoolers. Four hundred and ninety-six children for whom parents were seeking admission to a program for bright or gifted preschoolers in a midwestern city participated. All children were given the Thinking Creatively in Action and Movement Scale; 72 children were given the Slosson Intelligence Test, 354 were given the L-M edition of the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale, and the remaining 70 children were given the Stanford-Binet Fourth Edition. Results indicated that creativity was significantly related to intelligence when IQs were less than 120 but was not related at higher levels. However, the practical significance of the significant relationships was small. The implications of the findings for the development of programs for gifted or talented preschoolers are discussed."

Talented students from Iowa and Texas took the Quantitative, Reading Comprehension, and Verbal sections of the Lower Level of the Secondary School Admission Test (SSAT-L), which was developed by the Educational Testing Service for fifth through seventh graders. Students' scores covered nearly the entire possible range of the test, indicating that the SSAT-L effectively differentiated among talented elementary students."

Much research has shown that accelerating the mathematics curriculum provides a very good program for precocious students. Organizational plans that place mathematically gifted students together for mathematics instructions also offer opportunities for these students to perform well. Although technology-based instruction also appears to provide an efficacious way of providing instruction for mathematically gifted elementary students, this method should be examined further with older students and in long-term studies. Research with enriched curricula and non-computer-based instruction provided inconclusive evidence of efficacy for mathematically gifted students."

In this study, gender and academic achievement were studied in relation to career self-efficacy for female, male, and sex-balanced occupations. Girls had higher efficacy expectations for some female careers and lower efficacy expectations for some male careers than boys. Girls and boys did not differ in their efficacy expectations for sex-balanced occupations. The overall influence of gender on career self-efficacy was quite modest. Achievement was found to be a more powerful predictor of career self-efficacy than gender. These findings are discussed in relation to the need to enable talented young women to realize their abilities through career achievement."

Research on the leisure activities of young gifted children has been sparse in part because of the lack of psychometric instruments designed for use with children. The validity of the Tel-Aviv Activities Inventory, a measure of leisure activities specifically designed for children and adolescents was investigated in 934 junior/senior high school students. The 62 activities inventory items were entered for factor analysis. The 10-factor maximum likelihood solution with varimax rotation was selected, resulting in extracting factors most similar to the hypothesized factor structure. The results indicated that the instrument may be useful for career counseling with gifted and talented children. Recommendations for the revision of the current edition of the instrument are suggested."
807,1993.0,SEX-DIFFERENCES IN THE APTITUDES AND TALENTS OF CHILDREN AS JUDGED BY PEERS AND TEACHERS,"SEX-DIFFERENCES IN THE APTITUDES AND TALENTS OF CHILDREN AS JUDGED BY PEERS AND TEACHERS   Over 40 different descriptions of aptitudes and talents were distributed among nine experimental peer nomination forms (PNF). These PNFs were administered to two large samples of elementary and junior high school Pupils and to their teachers. Sex ratios were computed for each ability among those pupils who emerged as the 10% to 15% ablest in their group as independently judged by their peers and teachers. No less than 60% of the 42 items had a significant overrepresentation of girls (or boys); these ratios exceeded 2:1 in a majority of cases. Boys were judged to be more talented in physical aptitudes and technical talents, and girls were judged to be more talented in arts (especially music) and socioaffective aptitudes. Intercorrelations between data from six different samples showed a very high reproducibility of these sex ratios, regardless of whether the judges were peers or tear-hers or whether samples came from elementary or junior high schools. Various arguments are presented to demonstrate that these judgments by peers and teachers accurately represent the differential abilities manifested by boys and girls in the school environment."
808,1993.0,EARLY DEVELOPMENT OF LANGUAGE AND LITERACY SKILLS OF AN EXTREMELY PRECOCIOUS READER,"EARLY DEVELOPMENT OF LANGUAGE AND LITERACY SKILLS OF AN EXTREMELY PRECOCIOUS READER   Precocious literacy is a form of intellectual giftedness that occurs frequently in young children. This case study documents the emergence of reading ability in an extremely precocious reader between the ages of 2 years 7 months and 3 years 2 months. At the end of this period, the child's word recognition ability was conservatively estimated at the late first-grade level, and he was able to use knowledge of some level of letter-sound correspondences to sound out unfamiliar words and pseudowords. However, his writing skills did not begin to develop to a comparable degree until after he was 4 years old. The results are used to generate hypotheses about the nature and measurement of precocious reading and its relations with oral language and writing skills."
809,1993.0,WISC-R PROFILES OF CHILDREN WITH SUPERIOR INTELLECTUAL ABILITY,"WISC-R PROFILES OF CHILDREN WITH SUPERIOR INTELLECTUAL ABILITY   The WISC-R profiles of 456 Grade 3 students with full scale IQs of 120 and above were analyzed. Large subtest scatter, verbal-performance discrepancy, and idiographic variability appear to be normal for the test profiles of bright students. They excelled in complex reasoning but were often not different from average students in their attention span, memory, sequential reasoning, visual-spatial perception, or visual-motor coordination. Differences were identified in subgroups according to verbal or nonverbal strengths and gender. Boys showed strengths for simultaneous and visual-spatial reasoning, and girls showed strengths for sequential and social reasoning. Academic achievement varied as a function of full scale IQ and verbal or nonverbal strengths. Implications for educational programming are discussed."
810,1993.0,GIFTED EDUCATION - WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY,"GIFTED EDUCATION - WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY   Educators and parents of gifted students have many concerns as current movements of educational restructuring and reform sweep the country. However, unparalleled opportunities emerge from the swelling interest in education that focuses on the individual learning needs of all students. This interest should be perceived as a window of opportunity. In order to take advantage of the opportunities, gifted program personnel will want to keep an open mind toward concepts such as inclusion and collaboration. Without giving up the cause as champions of differentiated learning opportunities for highly able students, they can be accepted at last as key conversants in the educational dialogue. Then they can work in more integrative and productive ways with general classroom teachers, administrators, parents, and community leaders to develop exceptional student potential."

812,1993.0,CREATIVE GIFTEDNESS - A MULTIVARIATE INVESTMENT APPROACH,"CREATIVE GIFTEDNESS - A MULTIVARIATE INVESTMENT APPROACH   This article presents an ''investment'' view of creative giftedness. Creatively gifted individuals ''buy low and sell high.'' In other words, they propose ideas that initially seem odd, out of sync with the ideas of others. Over time, however, these gifted individuals bring these ideas to fruition, convince other people of the worth of their ideas. and then metaphorically sell the ideas when these ideas are at a ''high price.'' They then move on to the next novel idea. In order to buy low and sell high, one needs a combination of six resources that function interactively: intelligence, knowledge, styles of thinking, personality, motivation, and environment. Each of these resources and its role in creative giftedness is described. The interaction of resources, domain specificity of giftedness, and identification of creatively gifted individuals are also discussed."
813,1993.0,"DIVERGENT THINKING, CREATIVITY, AND GIFTEDNESS","DIVERGENT THINKING, CREATIVITY, AND GIFTEDNESS   Creativity is an important facet of giftedness. Creativity is, however, very difficult to define and measure. Divergent thinking tests are often used, though of course they really just estimate the potential for creative thought. In the past few years, the technologies for the assessment and enhancement of divergent thinking have changed dramatically. This article reviews the most recent research on divergent thinking. Several new assessment techniques are reviewed, including those using either lenient or stringent solution standards, those relying on ideational pools (examinees' total output of ideas), and those involving qualitative aspects of ideation. Recent research showing moderately high predictive validity coefficients is also reviewed. The role played by evaluation and valuation in the divergent thinking process is outlined, as is the role of problem definition and problem identification. Special considerations for the creativity of gifted children are noted throughout the article, and specific directions for future research on the divergent thinking of gifted children are presented in the conclusion."

Creative/productive behavior is examined by studying characteristics of youths who pursued and completed investigations based on their interests. The data sources were the family, the school, and the student. Methods of investigation included document analysis, questionnaires, and a student interview. Reflecting on experiences in their respective programs for the gifted, students revealed insights into the ways they obtained ideas for their projects, how their interest in their investigations was sustained, and what they learned from their efforts."
815,1993.0,EFFECTS OF A CREATIVE PROBLEM-SOLVING CURRICULUM ON STUDENTS OF VARYING ABILITY LEVELS,"EFFECTS OF A CREATIVE PROBLEM-SOLVING CURRICULUM ON STUDENTS OF VARYING ABILITY LEVELS   This study investigated the effects of a creative problem solving curriculum on students of varying ability. Subjects were 267 middle school students in six schools who had previously been designated as gifted, honors, or average. To assess problem solving, treatment and comparison students responded to a hypothetical problem before and after the treatment, with results scored by two independent judges for problem fluency, solution fluency, flexibility, originality, and use of criteria. Teachers rated the creativity, ability to work in groups, and potential giftedness of all students before and after the treatment. Treatment students showed significant gains in problem-solving ability compared with comparisons, with no significant differences among ability levels. Teacher ratings for gifted comparison students increased compared to those for gifted treatment students; ratings for treatment honors students generally increased. Teacher ratings for average students did not change, despite significant increases in their problem-solving ability."
816,1993.0,HOW WELL DO PEERS AGREE AMONG THEMSELVES WHEN NOMINATING THE GIFTED OR TALENTED,"HOW WELL DO PEERS AGREE AMONG THEMSELVES WHEN NOMINATING THE GIFTED OR TALENTED   To validate a set of peer nomination forms, 40 different prototypical descriptions were written to represent four aptitude domains (intellectual, creative, socio-affective, physical) and four talent fields (academic, technical, artistic, interpersonal). They were distributed among six experimental forms, which were paired and administered in counterbalanced order at a 3-week interval to a sample of 2350 pupils about equally divided between both sexes and three grades (4, 5, 6), and to the teachers of their 88 groups. Indices of reliability - interpeer agreement - were computed for each prototype in every group. A majority of the prototypes maintained acceptable interpeer agreement levels; important variations were observed associated with a small age effect, a significant group effect, and a very large prototype effect, confirming that interpeer agreement depends first and foremost on the specific aptitude or talent assessed. Consensus among peers was best for intellectual and physical aptitudes, and academic and artistic talents; it was worst for socio-affective aptitudes and interpersonal talents."
817,1993.0,MOVING INTO THE MAINSTREAM - REFLECTIONS ON THE STUDY OF GIFTEDNESS,"MOVING INTO THE MAINSTREAM - REFLECTIONS ON THE STUDY OF GIFTEDNESS   This position paper is a call for efforts to increase connections between studies of giftedness and mainstream psychological and educational research. Most mainstream researchers have paid scant attention to the literature on giftedness and have ignored the field's journals. However, studies of giftedness have contributed to mainstream theory and may play some special roles in theory development. Strategies for overcoming barriers to further integration with mainstream research are proposed."

819,1992.0,A GENERAL-THEORY FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF CREATIVE PRODUCTIVITY THROUGH THE PURSUIT OF IDEAL ACTS OF LEARNING,"A GENERAL-THEORY FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF CREATIVE PRODUCTIVITY THROUGH THE PURSUIT OF IDEAL ACTS OF LEARNING   This article presents a general theory for developing creative productivity in young learners by examining the interactions between and among the learner, the curriculum, and the teacher. Further interactions within the learner dimension of the theory are examined by analyzing the relationships between and among learners' abilities, interests, and learning styles. Teacher interactions are examined by analyzing teachers' knowledge of the discipline that they are teaching, instructional techniques, and the teachers' ''romance'' with the discipline. The curriculum is examined by analyzing the structure of disciplines, the content and methodology of disciplines, and the discipline's appeal to the imagination of students. Also proposed is a three-dimensional research paradigm for examining creative productivity: (a) the types of creativity we are attempting to develop, (b) the domains in which creative pursuits are carried out, and (c) the contextual variables that influence the creative process."
820,1992.0,CONTRIBUTIONS OF GIFTED EDUCATION TO GENERAL-EDUCATION IN A TIME OF CHANGE,"CONTRIBUTIONS OF GIFTED EDUCATION TO GENERAL-EDUCATION IN A TIME OF CHANGE   Educators in the field of gifted education should be involved in the educational dialogue known as the School Reform Movement both because of the need of gifted learners for positive changes in education and because of the potential of the field to contribute to improved education for a wide range of students. Gifted youngsters, like others, suffer from inadequately trained teachers, test-driven instruction, low-level texts, and curricula which engage neither thought nor interest. They are further at risk in settings which mandate student homogeneity and in which teachers are prone to ''teach to the middle.'' Further, the field of gifted education, by virtue of its principles and practices, has the opportunity to provide educational leadership in expanding views of intelligence, attention to underserved populations, a broadened view of democracy in education, differentiation and individualization of instruction and varied instructional models and strategies."
821,1992.0,EFFECTS OF THE FUTURE PROBLEM-SOLVING PROGRAM ON CHILDREN CONCERNS ABOUT THE FUTURE,"EFFECTS OF THE FUTURE PROBLEM-SOLVING PROGRAM ON CHILDREN CONCERNS ABOUT THE FUTURE   The first purpose of this study was to determine whether gifted students participating in the Future Problem Solving Program would feel that they had more control over their futures than either other gifted or average-ability students. The second purpose was to determine whether participants' concerns about the future would differ from those of nonparticipants. The final purpose was to determine the most frequently mentioned concerns about the future of these groups of children. Subjects were from a medium-sized city in the Southwest and were fourth, fifth, and sixth graders. Results showed significant differences in students' perceptions of their control over the future and their concerns about the future. There were also differences among their most frequently mentioned concerns. Students in the Future Problem Solving Program were interested in more global issues than nonparticipants and were more positive about their control over the future."
822,1992.0,THE EFFECTS OF PROBLEM-BASED LEARNING ON PROBLEM-SOLVING,"THE EFFECTS OF PROBLEM-BASED LEARNING ON PROBLEM-SOLVING   Problem-based instruction is designed to provide students with a guided experience in solving an ill-structured problem. All learning in problem-based instruction stems from students' initial questions about a problem situation. Currently used in medical school programs, problem-based curriculum has not been tested at the high school level. Science, Society and the Future (SSF) is an experimental problem-based course for gifted high school students. In the interdisciplinary course, students examine the meaning and impact of current science issues (the effect of electromagnetic fields on childhood leukemia, the health care system). In this study, SSF students and a group of comparison students were tested to determine changes in their spontaneous use of problem-solving steps as they consider an ill-structured problem. Results show some significant changes for the SSF group not observed in the comparison group."
823,1992.0,A DEVELOPMENTAL INVESTIGATION OF THE LIVES OF GIFTED WOMEN,"A DEVELOPMENTAL INVESTIGATION OF THE LIVES OF GIFTED WOMEN   Little research exists on intellectually gifted women in relation to their educational, personal, and career choices. This study explores the internal and external factors affecting educational and occupational choices made by gifted women at various times in their lives. A questionnaire was administered to a sample of intellectually gifted women representing the decades of the 1910s through the 1980s who attended a highly selective school for gifted females. Differences in personality and attitude factors were found across decades of graduation and between homemakers and career-oriented intellectually gifted women."

The examination is undertaken from an ipsative as well as a nomothetic perspective. The results indicate that (a) the educational and career attainment of these young women compare quite favorably both with other cohorts of gifted women and with criteria reflecting social expectation: (b) personal and relational accomplishments are identified almost as frequently as educational and career accomplishments as being their ''greatest achievements''; and (c) a substantial number of these young women at age 29 have yet to achieve the educational, career, and lifestyle aspirations they identified in adolescence. Implications for counseling gifted young women are discussed."

Data on overall enrollment, referral, and referral outcome were obtained by gender and grade from five school boards offering gifted programs. A greater number of boys than girls were enrolled in gifted programs. When the referral process for the most recent year was examined, however, no gender differences were observed in referral or in decision to enroll. The variability in the results observed underlines the importance of longitudinal data in delineating more fully the occurrence and pattern of gender differences in referral to and enrollment in gifted programs."

Detecting, estimating, and evaluating intelligence is still typically based on test data and IQ scores. ABC has learned to use additional yardsticks: a strong sense of self, an independent mind, a questioning attitude, a willingness to take risks and to persevere. If educators are sincerely interested in identifying gifted children from all parts of American society, multiple assessment procedures, including objective and subjective data from a variety of sources, must be used. Within every classroom in this country, including those enrolling minorities and the disadvantaged, the proportion of gifted students is the same as that found in the nation's most affluent communities. It is our challenge as educators to find these gifted children. And we must find them quickly, before inertia and indifference immobilize their minds."

The results indicated that there were few differences among the three parent groups in either the characteristics that had indicated to them that their child might be gifted, or in the attributes which they believed were current descriptors of their gifted child. Large group differences were present, however, between the White sample and the two minority group samples in the percentage of families who requested an evaluation their child for possible placement in the gifted and talented program. Fewer of the minority parents such a request. This factor could contribute to the underrepresentation of minority students in gifted programs."
832,1992.0,ACADEMIC UNDERACHIEVEMENT AMONG THE GIFTED - STUDENTS PERCEPTIONS OF FACTORS THAT REVERSE THE PATTERN,"ACADEMIC UNDERACHIEVEMENT AMONG THE GIFTED - STUDENTS PERCEPTIONS OF FACTORS THAT REVERSE THE PATTERN   Underachievement among the gifted has been a focus of research for over 35 years. With few exceptions, studies of interventions for gifted underachievers have demonstrated only limited success. This study investigated factors which had influenced the reversal of the underachievement pattern in 10 gifted students, ages 14 to 20, who moved from chronic underachievement to academic success. Results indicated six factors were influential in reversing poor school performance. There was evidence that some gifted underachievers may respond well to interventions incorporating educational modifications which focus on individual strengths and interests."
833,1992.0,FAST-PACED HIGH-SCHOOL SCIENCE FOR THE ACADEMICALLY TALENTED - A 6-YEAR PERSPECTIVE,"FAST-PACED HIGH-SCHOOL SCIENCE FOR THE ACADEMICALLY TALENTED - A 6-YEAR PERSPECTIVE   This is a 6-year study of academically talented students, 12 to 16 years old, who completed a 1-year course in high school biology, chemistry, or physics in 3 weeks at a residential summer program. Students demonstrated subject mastery by taking College Entrance Examination Board (CEEB) science achievement tests. Their mean scores were higher than those of high school juniors and seniors. Also examined were the relationships between students' achievement in science and mathematical and verbal aptitude test scores, or age. Mathematical ability seemed to be a better predictor of science than verbal ability. Except for biology, there was no significant relationship between achievement and age. Follow-up studies of achievement indicated that students accelerated in science performed well in science courses at their regular schools. The study suggests that academically talented students could begin high school sciences earlier than is currently allowed in most American schools."

In trials consistent with the Talent Search Identification Model developed at The Johns Hopkins University, an above-level form of the SSAT was administered to two samples of fifth and sixth graders. Mean scores for eighth- and ninth-grade normative samples are recommended as cutoffs for identifying highly able fifth- and sixth-grade students who could benefit from academically challenging programming."

The result was the ratification of a concise, mutually acceptable mission and goals statement that was designed to give direction to statewide efforts on behalf of gifted and talented children for years to come. The document provides focus and direction by defining common goals and recognizing ownership of the logical tasks belonging to each advocacy group. Flexibility for future growth and development in the field of education of the gifted is a salient feature of the goals described. The impact of the document was felt immediately in improved services for children, better inservice training for educators, and more focused policy at the state level."

Grouping heterogeneously and providing cooperative learning in heterogeneous groups leads to lowered achievement and motivation as well as poorer attitudes toward school. Academic achievement of American youth is lower than the achievement of youth in many Asian and European countries. If we wish to sustain or increase the academic achievement of American youth they should be grouped for instruction according to ability and achievement levels, but grouping practices should be flexible, and rigid tracking should be avoided."
838,1992.0,EDUCATIONAL DECISION-MAKING ON ACCELERATION AND GROUPING,"EDUCATIONAL DECISION-MAKING ON ACCELERATION AND GROUPING   This article provides an overview of key issues emanating from research and practice on acceleration and grouping. The author focuses on the fundamental importance of these two provisions for the gifted, examines them in the current context of school reform, and recommends a set of decision-making guidelines for practitioners to adopt for each issue. Acceleration guidelines include an emphasis on progressive development of learning based on mastery in content areas, flexibility in entrance and exit requirements for courses, and opportunities for telescoping and grade skipping. Grouping guidelines stress flexibility, opportunities for various forms of grouping, and independent learning options."
839,1992.0,META-ANALYTIC FINDINGS ON GROUPING PROGRAMS,"META-ANALYTIC FINDINGS ON GROUPING PROGRAMS   Meta-analytic reviews have focused on five distinct instructional programs that separate students by ability: multilevel classes, cross-grade programs, within-class grouping, enriched classes for the gifted and talented, and accelerated classes. The reviews show that effects are a function of program type. Multilevel classes, which entail only minor adjustment of course content for ability groups, usually have little or no effect on student achievement. Programs that entail more substantial adjustment of curriculum to ability, such as cross-grade and within-class programs, produce clear positive effects. Programs of enrichment and acceleration, which usually involve the greatest amount of curricular adjustment, have the largest effects on student learning. These results do not support recent claims that no one benefits from grouping or that students in the lower groups are harmed academically and emotionally by grouping."
840,1992.0,MATHEMATICS ACCELERATION OF HIGHLY TALENTED STUDENTS - AN EVALUATION,"MATHEMATICS ACCELERATION OF HIGHLY TALENTED STUDENTS - AN EVALUATION   The purpose of this study was to investigate the precollege mathematics preparation of students with high mathematical aptitude, most of whom were highly accelerated in mathematics. The nature and extent of mathematics coursework and math-related activities and measures of student achievement during the secondary school years were examined. Students evaluated their precollege mathematics preparation in terms of course availability and difficulty, school cooperation, and overall satisfaction. The typical student took calculus in Grade 9, followed by advanced mathematics coursework studied at a local college or magnet high school. Some students experienced difficulty in locating an appropriately challenging and cohesive course of study after first year calculus while still in high school. Despite students' radical acceleration, achievement in calculus and postcalculus coursework was high. Out-of-school math-related activities were prevalent. Gender differences were found in the degree of acceleration and choice of college major. Recommendations for a suitable precollege math program for this population are offered."
841,1992.0,THE IMPACT OF EARLY ENTRANCE TO COLLEGE ON SELF-ESTEEM - A PRELIMINARY-STUDY,"THE IMPACT OF EARLY ENTRANCE TO COLLEGE ON SELF-ESTEEM - A PRELIMINARY-STUDY   In a study investigating the effects of an early entrance to college program on self-esteem, students in the Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science (TAMS) completed the Adult Form of the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory (SEI) the week they began and again after one semester of participation in the program, a time period when the greatest changes in self-esteem would be anticipated. Overall differences between TAMS pretests and posttests were nonsignificant or negligible, indicating that the students' self-esteem did not change in a meaningful way during their first semester in the program. A number of items on the SEI showed significant changes, all in a negative direction. On the pretest, TAMS students did not differ significantly from subjects in SEI normative groups on any items. On the posttest, however, there were some differences in a negative direction. Observed changes in self-esteem may be attributed to the adjustment that all college freshmen experience when they leave home for the first time, as well as to changes in social comparisons."
842,1992.0,THE USE OF RADICAL ACCELERATION IN CASES OF EXTREME INTELLECTUAL PRECOCITY,"THE USE OF RADICAL ACCELERATION IN CASES OF EXTREME INTELLECTUAL PRECOCITY   This paper reviews the school histories of five extremely gifted children, of IQ 160 - 200, who have been radically accelerated. Prior to their acceleration, the children were retained in the regular classroom in a lockstep curriculum based on their chronological age and grade placement. They suffered severe intellectual frustration, boredom, lack of motivation, and social rejection by age-peers. and displayed significantly lowered levels of social self-esteem. A combination of grade-skipping and radical subject matter acceleration has given the children access to curricula commensurate with their academic achievement levels and the intellectual and social companionship of children who share their abilities and interests. The young accelerands are more stimulated intellectually, enjoy closer and more productive social relationships, and display healthier levels of social self-esteem than do equally gifted children who have been retained with age-peers of average ability."
843,1992.0,THE USE OF SUBJECT AND GRADE SKIPPING FOR THE PREVENTION AND REVERSAL OF UNDERACHIEVEMENT,"THE USE OF SUBJECT AND GRADE SKIPPING FOR THE PREVENTION AND REVERSAL OF UNDERACHIEVEMENT   Acceleration, including early entrance to kindergarten, grade skipping, and subject skipping, has been used as a strategy to prevent and reverse underachievement in a selected group of gifted students. Fourteen sets of parents and 11 students were interviewed to determine their perceptions of the effectiveness of the acceleration strategy. All the parents and all the students indicated they would make the same decision again. Only two of the school administrators and six of the receiving teachers were initially positive about the skipping, but most of them changed their positions with the child's success, at least in regard to the specific accelerated child. There appeared to be a period (between one quarter and a semester) during which teachers expressed concern over the students' adjustment, but students did not perceive themselves as having adjustment difficulties."

Previous research indicates that students do well academically at the UW, with grade point averages much higher than those earned by regular-age students, and that they adjust well to college life. This study examined student perceptions of early college entrance, focusing on the reasons students choose this unusual educational option, their experiences with peers, regular age students, and professors; and the effect of skipping high school on their social, emotional, and intellectual development."

The levels and types of programming offered to gifted students in rural and urban school districts were compared in this study. Rural and urban districts were also compared on their uses of ability grouping in regular education programs and academic acceleration. The results of the study revealed that rural school districts are less apt to use ability grouping or academic acceleration to provide a developed range of options for gifted and talented students. Sporadic extra-curricular activities tend to play more important roles in rural programs. Factors that influence the nature and quality of education of gifted and talented students in rural areas are discussed."

A Lesson Plan Evaluation Form (LPEF) was developed to provide systematic quantitative data about classroom functioning that are usually obtained only through attitudinal surveys. One hundred thirty-seven plans from 15 teachers were analyzed. The lesson plan analysis yielded useful information about program functioning in a cost-effective manner. Data from the LPEF were consistent with data from more traditional evaluation tools. The use of lesson plan analysis as a tool to measure program effectiveness should be further investigated.

This study provides data on the relationship between specific items perceived by parents to be indicators of giftedness in their young children and the children's actual measured ability level. Parental beliefs were found to be associated with actual IQ status. In particular, parents' beliefs about memory, creativity-imagination, and abstract thinking abilities were associated with higher IQ, and knowledge of body parts with lower IQ. These data suggest that (a) parents have specific and differentiated beliefs concerning the constituents of giftedness in their young children, (b) parents exhibit a fairly high degree of accuracy in their judgements of their children's ability level, and (c) parental beliefs differ as a function of the actual ability level of their children."

The study involved 158 prospective and experienced teachers who responded to six 1-page scenarios of students with varying backgrounds (gender, race, and socioeconomic status) and ability patterns (analytic, verbal, social, creative arts, motor, and control). Responses to each student included 25 trait ratings, judgments of appropriate programming and resources, and predictions of adult success. The findings indicate differential predictions of success, recommendations for programming and resources, and trait ratings for those with different patterns of giftedness and talent. For several trait ratings, teachers' reactions to ability patterns appeared to be magnified when the pattern was inconsistent with gender, race, or social class stereotypes. Overall, the findings of this study suggest that teachers may be sensitive to multiple intelligences (Gardner, 1983) if they are exposed to a sufficient range of information about individual students."
856,1992.0,GIFTED STUDENTS CONCEPTIONS OF ACADEMIC FUN - AN EXAMINATION OF A CRITICAL CONSTRUCT FOR GIFTED EDUCATION,"GIFTED STUDENTS CONCEPTIONS OF ACADEMIC FUN - AN EXAMINATION OF A CRITICAL CONSTRUCT FOR GIFTED EDUCATION   Academic fun is hypothesized to consist largely of the degree of success an individual anticipates from an activity. In this context, fun relates to the levels of arousal and control perceived to be afforded by the task. Gifted elementary and middle school students' conceptions of academic fun were examined using repertory grid techniques (e.g., Kelly, 1955). Results indicate that students' conceptions of fun are highly similar across age and gender. However, differences in ratings of academic situations suggest that gifted boys view technology and computer activities as more fun than girls do. In addition, confirming many suspicions, age trends revealed that mathematics decreases in perceived fun as children progress through school."

Advocates, even in a state with meager or threatened resources, can strengthen their leadership force through ongoing collaboration and dissemination. Essential elements of the dissemination design are: establishment of regional sites, team requirements for participation, small- and large-group sharing and problem solving, and the preparation and presentation of exemplary practices.

Factors that have promoted the development of programs for gifted students in the state are financial incentives, mandatory screening for giftedness, educational reform, and vigorous advocacy. Negative factors associated with the lack of a mandate have been inequities in access to programs, difficulties in assuring the quality of programs, and limited access to teacher preparation programs."
866,1991.0,EDUCATIONAL PARTNERSHIPS - GIFTED PROGRAM ADVOCACY IN ACTION,"EDUCATIONAL PARTNERSHIPS - GIFTED PROGRAM ADVOCACY IN ACTION   As advocates for gifted programs, professionals in gifted child education and special education must work closely with school reform efforts to ensure that appropriate representation and service to gifted pupils are embedded within the reform framework. They should examine the development of partnerships and assess the strengths and weaknesses of collaboratives. They also should conduct research to strengthen the development of such efforts. This article discusses the critical elements of educational partnerships and presents an example of a partnership project designed to enhance educational opportunities for gifted children in an urban school setting."
867,1991.0,MEDIA RELATIONS - WHAT EVERY ADVOCATE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THE TRICKS OF THE TRADE,"MEDIA RELATIONS - WHAT EVERY ADVOCATE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THE TRICKS OF THE TRADE   Effective use of media is an essential component of gifted program advocacy. Strategies for using media effectively include cultivating contacts with media personnel, targeting newsworthy content, and selecting an appealing format in which to feature the content. A gifted program's image can be enhanced by employing the Driver-Rider Matrix concept. The author provides practical suggestions for writing news releases and features, making radio and television presentations, conducting news conferences, and preparing a newsletter."

All subjects had previously participated in a study that examined specific factors in a supportive home environment related to the early development of accelerated reading abilities. During the origmaistudy, all Accelerated Readers read at a mid-first- to fifth-grade level; verbally produced vowel and consonant sounds when shown corresponding letters, and performed well when involved in inventive spelling activities. Nonreaders read no words and exhibited limited knowledge of letter-sound correspondences. When retested at the age of eight and nine years, the Accelerated Readers scored significantly higher than the Nonreaders on subtests measuring word attack and dictation: However, no significant differences were found on subtests measuring word recognition or comprehension. A review of school based data indicated that the majority of the subjects in the two groups had been provided the same type of basal reading instruction upon entry into elementary school despite significant differences in their reading capabilities at the age of four years."
870,1991.0,GIFTED AVERAGE READERS - DO THEY USE THE SAME READING STRATEGIES,"GIFTED AVERAGE READERS - DO THEY USE THE SAME READING STRATEGIES   The purpose of this research was to compare the reading processing strategies of gifted readers with those of average readers. A random sampling, stratified by sex and grade level, was taken from a population of 300 eighth-, tenth-, and twelfth-grade students. Subjects included 30 females and 30 males. Fourteen reading processing strategies were identified using think-aloud protocols as a measuring instrument. The strategies used significantly more by gifted than by average readers were rereading, inferring, anatyzing structure, watching or predicting, evaluating, and relating to content area. The strategies used significantly more by average than by gifted readers were word pronouncing concern and summarizing inaccurately."

Few instruments exist for this purpose, and reliability and validity information is not often available for the instruments that do exist. In this article, the development of the Student Product Assessment Form is reviewed. A description of the results obtained from content validation procedures, reliability findings, scoring, and interrater agreement and reliability techniques are provided."
872,1991.0,"PERSONALITY GROWTH OF FEMALE EARLY COLLEGE ENTRANTS - A CONTROLLED, PROSPECTIVE-STUDY","PERSONALITY GROWTH OF FEMALE EARLY COLLEGE ENTRANTS - A CONTROLLED, PROSPECTIVE-STUDY   Many educators fear that early college entrance may be too stressful for young adolescents and therefore deleterious to healthy personality development. Advocates of acceleration point out the absence of research support for such concerns. In fact, the available evidence is not conclusive because previous studies: (a) often fail to use standard, well-validated personality measures; and/or (b) do not examine student adjustment both before and after a period of acceleration. The present study examined the adjustment of 33 female accelerants by administering the California Psychological Inventory at the beginning and end of their first academic year in a residential early college entrance program. Accelerants evidenced a surprisingly consistent pattern of healthy personality growth over the course of the year. Similar growth was not observed in a control group of capable nonacceferants attending traditional high schools."

Adjustment was assessed from staff, student, and peer perspectives over the course of one academic year. Results indicate consistent predictive relationships between the Jackson Personality Inventory, the Self-Perception Profile for Adolescents, the Family Environment Scale, the Parent Adolescent Communication Scale, and four outcome adjustment measures. The importance of studying individual differences in how students adjust in acceleration programs is emphasized."

Several spectacularly young college graduates are mentioned. Two high-schools-within-college institutions are discussed. Then several critical points about the article are made. A few suggestions for conducting a longer-term, more definitive follow-up of educationally accelerated girls are given. Finally, the value of social adjustment, as usually defined, for the great occupational success of intellectually extremely able persons is questioned."

A discussion of assumptions underlying the Center and some of the problems that have been encountered in past research efforts serve as a rationale for the structure and mission of this new organization. Each of the component parts of the Center is described along with how the interacting components will attempt to provide the field with a sound research base that is responsive to the needs and interests of practitioners and that will lead to the development of a variety of consumer-oriented products. Special emphasis is given to procedures that are used to focus research efforts on populations that have traditionally been underrepresented in special programs for the gifted and talented. The Center is currently conducting a national research needs assessment study to ensure that studies carried out by the Center will be responsive to the perceived needs of practitioners. Information concerning the first year research studies from each of the participating universities is provided."
881,1991.0,UNDERREPRESENTATION OF MINORITY-STUDENTS IN GIFTED PROGRAMS - YES - IT MATTERS,"UNDERREPRESENTATION OF MINORITY-STUDENTS IN GIFTED PROGRAMS - YES - IT MATTERS   The underrepresentation of minority students in programs for the gifted has been a source of concern for many years. Most recently, Van Tassel-Baska, Patton,- and Prillaman (1989) in a national survey found ""... a clear underrepresentation of minority students, particularly Blacks, in gifted programs at the K-12 level ...."" Because there are so few studies dealing with the absolute efficacy of gifted programming in general, it is not surprising that fewer studies assess the impact of gifted programming on minority students. This paper combines data from two midwest cities to suggest that gifted programming has an impact on drop-out rates and college enrollment. The data presented make it clear that minority students benefit from gifted programs and that their continuing underrepresentation in such programs is indefensible."

A panel of 29 experts in the field of gifted education responded to the following questions: 1. Which key issues are perceived by the panel of experts as being the most important? 2. Which of the issues deserves top priority? 3. On issues deemed most important, what action should be taken at the federal, state, and local levels? 4 . What are the experts' definitions of the term ""gifted""? Six issues were identified as being most critical; 53 actions were suggested for the federal, state, and local levels ; and a three-part definition of the term ""gifted"" was developed. Details of the study are shared, and an issue not designated by the panelists as a high priority issue is discussed."

Nine experimental studies were located that dealt with pull-out programs for gifted students. The variables of self-concept, achievement, critical thinking, and creativity were quantified via meta-analysis. The results indicate that pull-out models in gifted education have significant positive effects for the variables of achievement, critical thinking, and creativity. However, gifted students' self-concepts were not affected by the pull-out programs."

The most intet-esting result was a significant three-way interaction among giftedness, speed, and flexibility, with metacognitive knowledge as the criterion. Regardless of speed, rigid (inflexible) gifted children had less metacognitive knowledge than flexible gifted children. Flexible gifted children who solved the problems quickly had more metacognitive knowledge than those who solved them slowly. Among average children, rigid subjects had less metacognitive knowledge, regardless of speed, and flexible average children showed more metacognitive knowledge when they were slower on the problems."

Restructuring, school improvement, learning styles, thinking skills, ""at risk,"" cooperative learning, and other issues being discussed throughout education can contribute to strengthening and improving gifted education. Equally important, gifted education can, and should, also bring important issues and lessons to all educators, and make many ""school reform"" and school improvement efforts more powerful. We need to be the strong voice that reminds all educators of the importance of challenging and nurturing the best potentials of all learners, so that minimum competencies will not become maximum competencies. Without active dialogue and two-way communication between gifted education and other school change and improvement efforts, both will suffer."
890,1991.0,"EDUCATIONAL-REFORM, VALUES, AND GIFTED STUDENTS","EDUCATIONAL-REFORM, VALUES, AND GIFTED STUDENTS   Six major educational reforms are currently being proposed or are currently being implemented in the United States. These reforms-search for excellence, cooperative learning, middle schools, master teacher certification, site-based management and accountability-rest upon cultural values as much as on educational research, and each carries potential for positive or negative impact on education of gifted students. The positive and negative elements of each reform are reviewed in turn. Educators of gifted students need to take proactive steps to let other educators and citizens know of their contributions to general education and how these reform movements could be shaped for the maximum benefit of all."
891,1991.0,GIFTED EDUCATION IN THE BALANCE - BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS WITH GENERAL-EDUCATION,"GIFTED EDUCATION IN THE BALANCE - BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS WITH GENERAL-EDUCATION   This article focuses on the relationship of gifted education to both special education and general education and traces the growing importance for gifted education of establishing linkages to general education and various aspects of the reform movement. The author advocates careful consideration by the field of the curriculum reform enterprise and suggests natural connections through the emphasis on mathematics, science, and technology; the emphasis on international education; the movement to infuse thinking skills into the curriculum; and the measurement-driven instructional focus. Moreover, the article considers recent research on teaching and learning and draws implications for practice by educators of the gifted. The effective schools literature and practice are also discussed in light of their effect on education for gifted learners. The author advocates a closer working relationship with general educators in order to address the major needs of the field in the areas of curriculum, instruction, and evaluation."
892,1991.0,THE REFORM MOVEMENT AND THE QUIET CRISIS IN GIFTED EDUCATION,"THE REFORM MOVEMENT AND THE QUIET CRISIS IN GIFTED EDUCATION   The reform movement in education appears to focus on the ways in which schools are organized and managed rather than on the interaction that takes place among teachers, students, and the material to be learned. In the process of designing reform to encourage our most promising students and also to meet the needs of at-risk students, we need to examine the types of changes currently being advocated. An examination of the various reform efforts and the effect that they are having on gifted education is provided in this article. Rather than allowing all reform movements to affect our students without our consent (especially those that call for the elimination of grouping), we need to address the impact of gifted education programs and practices and how they might influence the reform effort. We must also be concerned with continued advocacy for gifted programming, creating and maintaining exemplary programs and practices that can serve as models of what can be accomplished for high ability students. Simply to allow high ability students to be placed in classrooms in which no provisions will be made for their special needs is an enormous step backwards for our field. To lose our quest for excellence in the current move to guarantee equity will undoubtedly result in a disappointing, if not disastrous, education for our most potentially able children."
893,1991.0,AN ACADEMIC MODEL FOR EDUCATING THE MATHEMATICALLY TALENTED,"AN ACADEMIC MODEL FOR EDUCATING THE MATHEMATICALLY TALENTED   A usually unrecognized aspect of the ""school reform"" movement during the past two decades has been the huge increase in extracurricular academic efforts on behalf of intellectually exceptionally able boys and girls. Whereas in 1971 few students less than 14 years old took the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT), by 1990 more than 100,000 did. Those who score well are offered special, supplemental educational opportunities. The movement began at Johns Hopkins University in 1971 with the creation of the Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth (SMPY) and spread within a dozen years to other private universities, i.e., Duke, Northwestern, and the University of Denver. Also, many public universities have begun such talent searching and educational facilitating. This article traces the origin and development of the network of independent centers and projects based on the SMPY model."

The group as a whole was found to be quite successful. Compared to nonaccelerants, the early entrants tended to graduate in a shorter period of time and earn more honors at graduation. For the early entrants, starting college with a large number of Advanced Placement Program credits was found to be the best predictor of outstanding academic achievement. It seems advisable for young college entrants to have Scholastic Aptitude Test scores and content knowledge equal to or greater than that of the typical freshman at the college the student will attend."

Most research centered on precocious students who score well on tests. Largely overlooked are other gifted students with potential in mathematics. We suggest that future research focus on the identification of these students and on the contributions of home environments and spatial abilities, problem-solving strategies, and attributions for success of all G/T students in whatever manner they are defined."

The present study compared unpopular high ability students with average and popular groups on measures of achievement, family social status, and personality adjustment. Results indicate relatively few differences between average and popular students, but unpopular students are distinguished by lower social self-concept and academic self-esteem, as well as by less prestigious paternal occupations. There was no evidence that unpopular students were academically less capable, less mature, or more anxious than their more popular peers."

This new paradigm is the product of recent thinking in philosophy, the natural sciences, and the social sciences—the so-called ""new philosophy of science"" (Phillips, 1987)— and has been embraced primarily, but not exclusively, by investigators using qualitative methods. Drawing heavily upon the work of Lincoln and Guba (Lincoln & Guba, 1985; Guba & Lincoln, 1989), I delineate the axioms (basic beliefs) underlying this approach and then consider the methodological implications that follow logically from the axioms. Finally, I suggest some applications of postpositivist inquiry in the field of the education of the gifted."

The primary purposes of the study were: 1) to determine the philosophical and definitional considerations utilized by states in addressing issues related to the disadvantaged gifted, 2) to ascertain the major approaches to identification and program interventions utilized with these populations, and 3) to determine the level and extent of state funding patterns, policies, procedures, and program standards. The findings indicated that although states have been consistently positive in their philosophical orientation toward culturally diverse and low socioeconomic gifted students, they have lagged behind in incorporating these concerns for equity and pluralism into the definitional and funding structures of their gifted programs."

Results on the measures for 99 13-18-year-old students were intercorrelated with achievement in the Soweto Gifted Child Program (SGCP). Regression analyses indicated that 50-58% of the variance in performance in the SGCP was accounted for by several significant predictors; namely, two subtests (the Verbal Analogies Test and the Organiser) of the Learning Potential Assessment Device, school performance, and the combined Similarities subtests of the WAIS-R and WISC-R.

Although significant mean group differences were found on all subtests, they were only marginal for Coding, which depends strongly on speed. On the three subtests using speed bonus points, the high-scoring group gave more correct answers, but on only one, Block Design, was there a trend toward more bonus points for speed. The results are interpreted as casting serious doubt on the utility of speed bonuses in tests of general intelligence with gifted children."

Both groups completed a sociometric nomination instrument in which they rated classmates. Results were analyzed in terms of the percentage of students assigned to popular, rejected, or neglected categories by peers. A 2 (gifted) x 2 (gender) analysis was used. Gifted boys were most popular while gifted girls were least popular. Boys and girls not identified as gifted were rejected more than gifted pupils, and boys were more rejected than girls."
914,1990.0,AN ANALYSIS OF THE MOST FREQUENTLY CITED GIFTED JOURNAL ARTICLES SINCE THE MARLAND REPORT - IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCHERS,"AN ANALYSIS OF THE MOST FREQUENTLY CITED GIFTED JOURNAL ARTICLES SINCE THE MARLAND REPORT - IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCHERS   Over 500 separate journal articles were reviewed to identify the 25 most frequently cited articles between 1972, the year the Marland Report was published, and 1988. To qualify for the data base the article must have used the term ""gifted"" or some related term (e.g., ""giftedness,"" ""genius,"" ""precocious"") in the title or have been indexed by ERIC or Psychological Abstracts with that term as a descriptor. The 25 most frequently cited articles were compared to a random sample of 25 articles from the same data set on a number of characteristics (e.g., purpose, theoretical basis, topical area, research design, and statistical methods). In general, comparisons on these and other variables showed few differences between frequently cited and randomly chosen articles. In comparison to other psychological/ educational disciplines gifted articles were cited much less frequently and used less sophisticated research designs and statistical analyses. Furthermore, articles tended to lack either a theoretical or research basis. Implications of these findings for the discipline are discussed."

The controversies that arose are divisible into two consecutive periods. The ""onset"" period , which spans the years of the late nineteenth century, centers on the contributions of Charles Darwin, FrancesGalton, and Karl Pearson. During this time, the promise of selective breeding led to the founding of the eugenics movement. The ""flowering"" period, which en compasses the early years of the twentieth century, deals mainly with Lewis M. Terman's attempts to resolve nature-nurture disputes associated with intellect and gift edness. The commentary covers events that led to the 1928 yearbook, Nature and Nurture.

Six key areas are highlighted: family roles and adaptations, sibling relationships, parental self concept, neighborhood and community issues; educational issues, and development of the child. Sugggestions are given for the use of these areas as a framework for future educational and counseling efforts."
921,1990.0,PREDICTORS OF ACHIEVEMENT IN MATHEMATICS FOR GIFTED MALES AND FEMALES,"PREDICTORS OF ACHIEVEMENT IN MATHEMATICS FOR GIFTED MALES AND FEMALES   The purpose of this study was to examine the factors that are predictive of achievement in fast-paced mathematics classes for high abitity male and female adolescents. The predictive value of three categories of factors were explored: ability, previous experience and exposure to the content area, and individual student characteristics. These were used to predict three out comes: entry-level knowledge, learning during the program, and learning rate. Results showed. that outcomes for females were more predictable than for males. For both males and females, previous experience variables were the most important in predicting learning outcomes. For females, parental teaching and tutoring of others related to learning, whereas for males, participation in math clubs was the important previous experience variable."

Although . such tables are accurate for the ""average"" child, they greatly overestimate the rarity of rarity of V-P discrepancies in high IQ children (over half of whom show a V-P discrepancy larger than 15 points). To lend greater accuracy to the interpretation of WISC-R profiles of high IQ children, a specialized table is provided for determin ing the frequency of occurrence of V-P discrepancies in profiles of high IQ children and warnings are offered regarding the adverse effect of subtest substitution or omission when administering the WISC-R to high IQ children."

Fifty gifted students (22 boys, 28 girls) were tested with the gifted identification battery from Stanford-Binet IV and the SRA Educational Ability Series (EAS). Several Pearson product-moment correlations, corrected for restriction of range, were statistically significant and appear to be sufficiently high for the EAS to serve adequately as a screening test. The discrepancies between the standard scores of the two tests were low and favored the EAS."

It reflects upon the application of this relationship to gifted education. The discussion centers on the teaching and learning styles of Darwin and Henslow, the role of interests and of time spent together, the friendship which Henslow offered Darwin (particularly during the Beagle voyage), and the character traits of Henslow as mentor."
930,1990.0,ASPECTS OF PERSONALITY AND PEER RELATIONS OF EXTREMELY TALENTED ADOLESCENTS,"ASPECTS OF PERSONALITY AND PEER RELATIONS OF EXTREMELY TALENTED ADOLESCENTS   Exceptionally gifted students may be at risk for problems in social and emotional development. To discover if peer relations are affected by type and/or amount of giftedness, extremely mathematically or verbally talented 13 year-olds (top 1 in 10,000) were compared to modestly gifted students (top 1 in 20) of similar age on measures of popularity and peer acceptance, participation in group activities, and personality traits. The verbatly or mathematically talented students were also contrasted on the same measures. Virtually no differences in group activities or personality traits were found. In their ratings of peer perceptions, the modestly gifted group exceeded the extremely gifted, especially the verbally gifted, in being considered athletic and popular, and in social standing. The modestly gifted also rated themselves as more extroverted, socially adept, and uninhibited. Perceptions of peer ratings of importance and acceptance were higher for the mathematically than the verbally gifted. Thus, extremely precocious adolescents, especially the verbally precocious, may be at greater risk for developing problems in peer relations than modestly gifted youth."
931,1990.0,SOCIAL-INTERACTION AND METACOGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT IN GIFTED PRESCHOOLERS,"SOCIAL-INTERACTION AND METACOGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT IN GIFTED PRESCHOOLERS   The preschool period has been identified as a critical period for the emergence of metacognitive skills. Vygotskian theory suggests that the use of planning, monitoring, and evaluation strategies which characterizes the independent performance of gifted school-age children may be most evident during the preschool period in social leaming contexts in which metacognitive functions are largely controlled by adults. The results of an observational study of collaboration styles of mothers and gifted preschoolers during problem solving are discussed in relation to Vygotskian concepts of the zone of proximal development, internalization, and the role of instruction in development."
932,1990.0,COGNITIVE PROFILES OF VERBALLY AND MATHEMATICALLY PRECOCIOUS STUDENTS - IMPLICATIONS FOR IDENTIFICATION OF THE GIFTED,"COGNITIVE PROFILES OF VERBALLY AND MATHEMATICALLY PRECOCIOUS STUDENTS - IMPLICATIONS FOR IDENTIFICATION OF THE GIFTED   Performance on tests of specific abilities commonly associated with intelligence was contrasted between 13-year-olds identified as extremely precocious (top 1 in 10,000) in either verbal or mathematical reasoning ability. Such students differ cognitively. Verbally precocious students scored higher on verbal and gerieral knowledge types of tests, and mathematically precocious students scored higher on tests of nonverbal reasoning, spatial ability, and memory. Results from the factor analysis of test scores (excluding memory test scores) yielded three factors: spatial/speed, verbal, and nonverbal. Mathematically talented students had higher scores on the nonverbal and speed factors; verbally talented students had higher scores on the verbal factor. Thus, at least two distinct forms of giftedness seem to exist (i.e., verbal and nonverbal). Their evolution, moreover, appeared to follow different developmental paths, consistent with Gagne (1985)."
933,1990.0,CREDIT AND PLACEMENT ISSUES FOR THE ACADEMICALLY TALENTED FOLLOWING SUMMER STUDIES IN SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS,"CREDIT AND PLACEMENT ISSUES FOR THE ACADEMICALLY TALENTED FOLLOWING SUMMER STUDIES IN SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS   The purposes of this study were to ascertain the proportion of academically talented students aged 12 to 16 who pursued appropriate school placement and/or credits for coursework completed at special summer academic programs, and to determine how their schools responded to their requests. In November 1986, 1215 students who attended science and mathematics classes sponsored by the Johns Hopkins University during the summer of 1986 were sent questionnaires regarding their subsequent status at their regular schools pertaining to credit and placement issues. Advanced placement was given more often than credit, although in most cases both were awarded, particularly for high school level coursework."
934,1990.0,THE EFFECTS OF GROUP TRAINING ACTIVITIES ON STUDENTS INITIATION OF CREATIVE INVESTIGATIONS,"THE EFFECTS OF GROUP TRAINING ACTIVITIES ON STUDENTS INITIATION OF CREATIVE INVESTIGATIONS   This study examined the effects of group training and several environmental and personal factors on 515 students' decisions to initiate creative investigations in new gifted education programs. Forty-eight groups of above average ability students in grades 3-8 were randomly , assigned to either control or experimental groups. Students in the treatment group received seven lessons in organizing a creative investigation. Initiation of a creative investigation was the dependent variable. Parsonal variables and group membership were entered into a hierarchical discriminant function analysis in an effort to identify the strength of the treatment beyond the personal variables of grade, sex, self-efficacy, learning style preferences, achievement, and academic aptitude. All eight predictor variables proved significant and accounted for 22% of the variance between groups."

943,1989.0,EDUCATIONAL ENCOURAGEMENT BY PARENTS - ITS RELATIONSHIP TO PRECOCITY AND GENDER,"EDUCATIONAL ENCOURAGEMENT BY PARENTS - ITS RELATIONSHIP TO PRECOCITY AND GENDER   Family involvement and encouragement have significant impact on the eventual display of talent. In the display of mathematical talent, there are large gender differences (Penbow, 1988). Can differences in family encouragement given to gifted females and males help explain this gender gap? The present study addressed that question. It was an investigation into: (1) parental support and encouragement of quantitative and verbal pursuits for extremely mathematically or verbally talented students; (2) the relation of such behaviors to talent development and gender differences, and (3) possible differences in the process for modestly versus extremely gifted students. No major differences were found between parents of extremely precocious children and of modestly gifted children, except a greater paternal involvement for the extremely precocious. Our results did indicate that parents differentiate support as a function of child's talent domain but not as a function of gender. Parents' behaviors were somewhat stereotypical; fathers were more involved in quantitative areas, and mothers tended to be viewed as the primary source of encouragement in verbal areas. It was concluded that the stereotyped behaviors of parents may negatively influence subsequent achievement of gifted females in math/science."
944,1989.0,VALIDATION OF A SHORT FORM OF THE WISC-R WITH ACCELERATED AND GIFTED HISPANIC STUDENTS,"VALIDATION OF A SHORT FORM OF THE WISC-R WITH ACCELERATED AND GIFTED HISPANIC STUDENTS   The summed scores of the WISC-R Similarities and Vocabulary subtests of the Verbal scale, and the Picture Arrangement and Block Design of the Performance scale, used as designated dyads, were cross-validated with the full scale WISC-R Scores for 96 Hispanic students participating in the program for the accelerated and gifted. Results indicate that the Similarities-Vocabulary and the Picture Arrangement-Block Design dyads are potentially useful tools for screening Hispanic students. However, school personnel are cautioned against using these test scores as the only criteria for the selection of Hispanic students for gifted classes."
945,1989.0,WHAT ARE THEY THINKING WHEN WERE TEACHING CRITICAL THINKING,WHAT ARE THEY THINKING WHEN WERE TEACHING CRITICAL THINKING   The teaching of critical thinking is an important part of gifted program curricula. This descriptive study address es the issue of the effectiveness of such teaching by comparing student perceptions of a lesson on critical thinking with teachers' stated objectives. The students' perceptions were compared to their teachers' stated objective obtained in separate interviews. Teacher and student responses were stimulated by videotapes of the lessons. The findings indicate that gifted students are able to identify the teacher's intentions and to articulate their own mental processes as they work through a thinking procedure in a lesson.

The research reported here describes development, testing, and use of a new instrument, Clark's Drawing Abilities Test, and its success in screening and/or identifying students for a visual arts program for artistically gifted students. The test was admmistered along with the Childrdn's Embedded Figures Test, and the results of both measures subsequently were compared to teacher ratings of students. Significant correlations were obtained among these three measures. Analyses of validity are reported here. Reliability is also reported as expressed in high correlatons among test items."

Experience in problem solving with computers can aid in the early attainment of advanced mathematical concepts and can be used for early credit in college level computer science courses.
954,1989.0,A SURVEY OF PROCEDURES USED FOR IDENTIFYING GIFTED LEARNING-DISABLED CHILDREN,"A SURVEY OF PROCEDURES USED FOR IDENTIFYING GIFTED LEARNING-DISABLED CHILDREN   Since the early 1970s, concern for children who are both gifted and handicapped has risen dramatically. Books written about this emerging field deal with identification and programmatic concerns (e.g., Fox, Brody, and Tobin, 1983) and also with case studies illustrating the ways in which the two conditions may coexist (Whitmore and Maker, 1985). This research focuses on the problems involved in identifying the child who is both gifted and learning disabled (GLD). The state of the art is demonstrated by surveying procedures in use in Texas by special education and gifted programs. Results from the survey yield characteristics of GLD children that are consistent with observations in the litetature."
955,1989.0,THE EFFECTS OF SINGLE PARENTHOOD ON SCHOOL-ACHIEVEMENT IN A GIFTED POPULATION,"THE EFFECTS OF SINGLE PARENTHOOD ON SCHOOL-ACHIEVEMENT IN A GIFTED POPULATION   The most obvious social trend affecting families during the past three decades has been the steadily rising number of single-parent households. Research indicates that students from single-parent families demonstrate is lower levels of school achievement than their peers livinq in two-parent homes. However, the impact of single parenthood on gifted children has not been established. A study of children who recently attended the University of Oregon's Summer Enrichment Program for Talented and Gifted Students suggests that the school achievement of gifted students is negatively affected if they come from a single-parent household."

It also examined differences between expert and novice teachers of the gifted by comparing patterns of need, efficacy, and use in 318 preservice teachers, classroom teachers, and teachers of the gifted. Data were gathered using a seven point Likert-scale questionnaire. Correlations between teacher efficacy and need and between teacher efficacy and use were consistently higher than those between need and use. Preservice teachers, classroom teachers, and teachers of the gifted were successfully separated by a function of need and efficacy, with the most potent contributions made by efficacy variables. Classroom teachers and teachers of the gifted were separated by a function of need, efficacy, and use, with the most powerful contributions made by use of strategies."

This technique has been judged very favorably by experts in the field. Unfortunately, the research on which these judgments are based is fraught with important methodological weaknesses. A critical analysis of the 13 validation studies of PNFs is presented to justify this assertion. Since PNF's offer advantages that make them a potentially worthy technique, a 4-step blueprint for research on their psychometric qualities is also described: 1) developing a taxonomy of abilities or talents to be assessed by peers, 2) drafting experimental PNFs, 3) evaluating their reliabilities, especially interjudge agreement, 4) conducting rigorous validity studies."
960,1989.0,CHILD ADJUSTMENT AND PARENT USE OF THE TERM GIFTED,"CHILD ADJUSTMENT AND PARENT USE OF THE TERM GIFTED   The present study examines the relationship between child adjustment and parent use of the term ""gifted."" Mothers and fathers of 482 children enrolled in a university-based summer enrichment program were assessed on measures of self-concept, anxiety, and peer status. Although over 90% of parents indicated that they think of their child as gifted, approximately 25-30% of the parents refrained from using the term. Use of the term was not associated with IQ or number of years in a gifted program, but children whose parents used the term were consistently less well adjusted on both self-report and peer-report measures. Findings are discussed in the context of theories about the potentially adverse effects of positive labeling on child development. Methodological cautions about the interpretation of these findings are noted."

This paper describes an attempt to overcome these barriers. Twp New York State County Boards of Cooperative Services (B.O.C E.S.) cooperated to begin a program for 32 fifth and sixth grade academically advanced students from 19 schools covering 2600 square miles. The local schools sent students one full day a week to one of five sites for advanced level study in humanities and science.

974,1989.0,PRACTITIONER OBJECTIONS TO THE ACADEMIC ACCELERATION OF GIFTED-CHILDREN,"PRACTITIONER OBJECTIONS TO THE ACADEMIC ACCELERATION OF GIFTED-CHILDREN   Despite extensive recent reviews that fail to document harm from early admission and acceleration, many school districts are still reluctant to employ such educational techniques. This paper reports the results of a large, mailed survey of attitudes toward these practices as reported by coordinators of gifted, school psychologists, principals, and teachers (554 respondents) and a follow-up study that explored the origin of such attitudes. The major concern of all groups is the potential for harm to the social and emotional development of accelerants, though coordinators of programs for gifted and talented show significantly more positive views toward early admission and acceleration along every dimension. Personal experience (self or family member) with acceleration was most highly related to positive attitude toward the practice. Respondents viewed early admission and grade skipping as identical. This view, coupled with the prevalence of citations by practitioners of inadequately designed and inappropriately applied ""early admission studies,"" presents an impediment to employment of any acceleration options. Implications for researchers and leaders in the field are discussed."

Subjects consisted of 1,698 elementary grade students, 236 teachers, 120 parents, and 10 principals. Data analysis revealed positive changes in student and teacher attitudes. Student creative products were numerous and exceeded the norm of typical student creative output. Most notable among qualitative data analysis were: remarkably favorable changes in attitudes toward education of the gifted on the part of classroom teachers and the general student population, large increases in student centered enrichment activities and work on self-selected interests, greater cooperation between classroom teachers and gifted education specialists, and more favorable attitudes toward special programming on the part of parents."

The first objective involved analyzing data from 509 schools. Four stringent criteria were applied to isolate the top 2% of the schools, and these were labeled exemplary schools. Each of the exemplary schools had developed viable independent study research programs in mathematics. The key ingredients included the following: dynamic research-oriented math teachers, development of problem-centered courses that used no text or tests, active administrative support, active recruiting, and contact with nearby universities. None of the schools had above average facilities or extensive computer resources."

Seventh and eighth grade students who had participated in RDIM programs for at least four years were compared with comparable students in a near-by district who received no services. Participation in an RDIM program and number of projects in school were identified as significant predictors of creative productivity outside school. RDIM students who did Type III projects were more likely to report that the project affected their career goals, improved research skills, led to a more positive attitude toward school, and increased insight into personal strengths and weaknesses than students not in the RDIM program who completed major school projects."
987,1988.0,THE MULTIPLE MENU MODEL FOR DEVELOPING DIFFERENTIATED CURRICULUM FOR THE GIFTED AND TALENTED,"THE MULTIPLE MENU MODEL FOR DEVELOPING DIFFERENTIATED CURRICULUM FOR THE GIFTED AND TALENTED   The history of curriculum development for the gifted has witnessed a seesaw effect rather than an appropriate balance between authentic knowledge (content) and instructional techniques (process). The Multiple Menu Model is a practical set of planning guides that can assist curriculum developers in combining content with instructional strategies. Menus are provided in the areas of Knowledge, Instructional Objectives and Student Activities, Instructional Strategies, Instructional Sequences, and Artistic Modification. Each of the five planning menus is designed to provide specific forms of guidance for the construction of curricular material that is consistent with generally agreed upon goals of gifted education. A lesson planning guide is designed to synthesize and insure representation of the content and process selected from the respective menus."
988,1988.0,THE PERCEIVED COMPETENCE OF INTELLECTUALLY TALENTED STUDENTS,"THE PERCEIVED COMPETENCE OF INTELLECTUALLY TALENTED STUDENTS   Upper primary gifted boys and girls were compared with nongifted children on self-perceptions of competence in four areas: cognitive, physical, social, and general self-worth. Gifted students perceived themselves as more competent than their nongifted peers in the cognitive and general self-worth areas, but not in the physical and social areas. Of the gifted children, those in a full-time segregated program had relatively lower perceived cognitive and physical competence than those in a part-time extension program. Sex differences were also observed."
989,1988.0,DO TEACHERS FAVOR HIGH ACHIEVERS,"DO TEACHERS FAVOR HIGH ACHIEVERS   Teacher interactions during mathematics lessons with high achieving and other students were examined in this study. At the grade 7 level teachers interacted less frequendy and for less time with the best students. The data for the grade 10 sample were more complex. Teachers again spent less time interacting with the best students but called on them more frequently for certain interactions. Greater teacher attention given to high achieving boys compared with high achieving girls, reported in earlier research, was not replicated in this study."
990,1988.0,HIGH ABILITY LEARNING-DISABLED STUDENTS - HOW ARE THEY DIFFERENT,"HIGH ABILITY LEARNING-DISABLED STUDENTS - HOW ARE THEY DIFFERENT   The purpose of the research was to investigate what characteristics distinguish High Ability/LD students from learning disabled students with average cognitive ability and from high ability students. One hundred-twelve high ability or learning disabled students in grades four through six participated in the study: High Ability, High Ability/LD, and LD/Average. A variety of instruments was used to assess and compare cognitive and motivational patterns in the three groups. Discriminant analyses indicated that the three groups are distinguishable. As might be expected, the greatest group difference existed between high ability nondisabled students and both learning disabled populations. A second discriminant function provided information about differences between the two learning disabled populations."
991,1988.0,STATE ASSOCIATIONS FOR GIFTED TALENTED EDUCATION,"STATE ASSOCIATIONS FOR GIFTED TALENTED EDUCATION   With continued national emphasis on excellence in education, an increasing number of new parent/educator advocacy associations for gifted and talented education have been formed. A national survey was conducted to determine membership status, dues, and staffing patterns of state associations for the gifted and to gather information about services and programs available for gifted children, their parents, and teachers. Membership ranges between 50 and 6,000 and consists mostly of parents and educators togefher. With the exception of 10 states, the G/T advocacy groups are organized, led, and managed by volunteers. Most associations publish a quarterly newsletter, and several associations distribute print material for parents on the nature and needs of gifted children and provide in-service for new and experienced teachers of the gifted. Each state association holds an annual state-wide conference with keynote speakers and numerous break-out sessions. Annual awards in various categories are presented at the conferences."
992,1988.0,GIFTED CHILDRENS RESPONSES TO A COGNITIVE STRESSOR,"GIFTED CHILDRENS RESPONSES TO A COGNITIVE STRESSOR   The purpose of this study was to investigate the differences in physiological responses to an induced cognitive stressor when comparing intellectually gifted children with nongifted children. After the administration of a color-discrimination stressor, the skin temperature change for 30 intellectually gifted junior high school students was compared to that of 30 nongifted students. The temperature change of the gifted sample was significantly less than that of the nongifted group, and the recovery time of the gifted group was considerably faster. The findings indicate that gifted children may be less prone to react to cognitive stressors and recover more rapidly than nongifted children."
993,1988.0,GIFTED ADOLESCENTS ATTITUDES TOWARD THEIR GIFTEDNESS,"GIFTED ADOLESCENTS ATTITUDES TOWARD THEIR GIFTEDNESS   The purpose of this study was to assess gifted adolescents' views of their own giftedness and their perceptions regarding how giftedness is viewed by others. One hundred eighty-four gifted adolescents completed an open-ended questionnaire on giftedness. Resutts indicated that their views of giftedness were not unidimensional. They were positive about their giftedness but did not believe that others were positive. Also, gifted adolescents viewed giftedness as positive with regard to their personal growth and academic performance but as negative in social relations with others. Gifted adolescents have strongly mixed attitudes about their giftedness."
994,1988.0,PROFILES OF THE GIFTED AND TALENTED,"PROFILES OF THE GIFTED AND TALENTED   After several years of observations, interviews, and reviews of literature, the authors have developed six profiles of gifted and talented children and youth. These profiles help educators and parents to look closely at the feelings, behaviors, and needs of the gifted and talented. Also, tips on identification of each profile are included as well as information on facilitating the gifted and talented in the school and home."
995,1988.0,GIFTED AND TALENTED YOUNG-WOMEN - ANTECEDENTS AND CORRELATES OF LIFE SATISFACTION,"GIFTED AND TALENTED YOUNG-WOMEN - ANTECEDENTS AND CORRELATES OF LIFE SATISFACTION   This study examined the antecedents and correlates of general life satisfaction as reported by 108 gifted and talented young women. Measures of socio-affective traits, instrumentality and expressiveness, and social self esteem were obtained across, three points in time; sophomore and junior years in high school and in young adulthood. The results of the longitudinal analyses supported the predicted centrality of instrumental self perception, not only to social self esteem but also to occupational confidence and general life satisfaction. Implications for counseling gifted and talented female adolescents are discussed."
996,1988.0,ON COPING AND DEFENDING - APPLYING BRUNER PERSONAL GROWTH PRINCIPLES TO WORKING WITH GIFTED TALENTED STUDENTS,ON COPING AND DEFENDING - APPLYING BRUNER PERSONAL GROWTH PRINCIPLES TO WORKING WITH GIFTED TALENTED STUDENTS   Dealing succesfully with the changes and challenges associated with public recognition of giftedness is crucial for bright and talented students. In this article the authors critically examine popular approaches for working with gifted students in affective areas. They present two systems for helping gifted students handle the social-emotional tasks involved in actualizing their abilities and Explore implications of these systems for persons closely involved with gifted/talented students.
997,1988.0,FAMILY SYSTEMS CHARACTERISTICS AND UNDERACHIEVING GIFTED ADOLESCENT MALES,"FAMILY SYSTEMS CHARACTERISTICS AND UNDERACHIEVING GIFTED ADOLESCENT MALES   The family systems of 45 underachieving and 45 achieving gifted male adolescents were compared on the variables of family functionality, family satisfaction, family environment (conflict, achievement orientation, independence, and expressiveness), and achievement satisfaction. Families with achieving and underachieving gifted students did not differ on the measure of family functionality. Achievement satisfaction and family satisfaction differentiated families on the basis of the status of their gifted student; achievement satisfaction differentiated functional from dysfunctional families. Families with achieving gifted students expressed higher achievement satisfaction than families with underachieving gifted students, and dysfunctional families with an underachieving adolescent were less satisfied with their child's achievement than were functional families with an underachieving student."
998,1988.0,EMOTIONAL ADJUSTMENT OF GIFTED-CHILDREN,EMOTIONAL ADJUSTMENT OF GIFTED-CHILDREN   The personality functioning of 90 children with intelligence quotients greater than 135 was examined with the Child Behavior Checklist(CBCL) and the Child Behavior Checklist-Teacher's Reobrt Form (CBCL-TRF). Results for the CBCL and the CBCL-TRF demonstrated that the incidence of psychopathology in this sample was comparable to that in the normative population. Only 9% of the sample were rated as having clinical levels of psychopathology. Children with intelligence quotients greater than 150 were shown to have no greater levels of psychopathology than those with intelligence quotients between 136 and 140.

These tenets govern the direction that curriculum for them may take and the manner in which educators interact with these children. First, young gifted children have special learning needs. They differ in that they have the capability to learn at greater depth and more quickly, and they have interests which may predate those of their peers. Second, curriculum should be drawn from their special interests and needs. Next, the work of childhood is play; therefore, the curriculum of young gifted children must emphasize exploration and play. Finally, young gifted children should be engaged in the curricular decision making process. This article elaborates these four principles in curricular decision making for young gifted children."
1007,1988.0,PRECOCIOUS READING-ABILITY - WHAT DOES IT MEAN,"PRECOCIOUS READING-ABILITY - WHAT DOES IT MEAN   The results of studies of precocious reading ability are reviewed, and the implications of these results for parents, teachers, and educational policy makers are discussed. Precocious reading ability is a complex skill, and levels of specific subskills vary widely among individuals. Although precocious reading ability is moderately associated with general intelligence, some highly .intelligent children do not read early and some precocious readers are of average or subnormal intelligence. Although parents should not expect to be able to teach their infants to read, they may encourage the early development of reading through natural and mutually enjoyable activities."

Identified initially at age 12 or less, they reside all over the United States and in two foreign countries. The sex ratio is 12 boys per 1 girl. The group tends to be quite able verbally, but much more so mathematically. Most of their parents are well educated. Some of these young students are vastly more accelerated in school grade placement than are the majority of the group. Other relevant characteristics are also discussed."
1009,1988.0,A CROSS-SECTIONAL DEVELOPMENTAL-STUDY OF THE SOCIAL-RELATIONS OF STUDENTS WHO ENTER COLLEGE EARLY,"A CROSS-SECTIONAL DEVELOPMENTAL-STUDY OF THE SOCIAL-RELATIONS OF STUDENTS WHO ENTER COLLEGE EARLY   Sixty-three students who had entered college at age 14 or younger supplied data on the number and ages of their friends, time spent together in various activities, number of times various sensitive topics were discussed, and degree of shared intimacy. Striking differences appeared during the first and second years between the proportions of the friendship investment with agemates and older university classmates. By junior year, and thereafter, however, early entrants appeared to have established relations with older students of breadth and depth at least equivalent to those already existing with agemates. Young college graduates were pronouncedly more invested in relationships with older individuals. These findings suggest that early entrants support each other during the first and second years at the university and use these relations as a base for developing fulfilling friendships with older students as upperclasspersons and graduates."
1010,1988.0,TEACHERS PERCEPTIONS OF GIFTEDNESS,"TEACHERS PERCEPTIONS OF GIFTEDNESS   This investigation examined prospective and experienced teachers' perceptions of relatedness among abilities. Participants included 111 undergraduate education students without teaching experience and 79 graduate students who were experienced teachers. Students were required to indicate the resemblance among 20 different kinds of abilities, using sorting, similarity ratings, and/or trait ratings. These data were analyzed using clustering, multidimensional scaling, and factor analysis approaches. Both prospective and experienced teachers tended to agree on five categories of giftedness: analytic or cognitive ability, personality and social Skills, creative arts, motor skitts, and verbal ability. Although the findings resemble Gardner's (1983) ""multiple intelligences"" and suggest that teachers hold appropriate beliefs about relationships among abilities, further investigations are required to explore the extent to which their conceptions relate to their day-to-day interactions, judgments, and decisions in their classrooms"
1011,1988.0,STUDENTS PERCEPTIONS OF ABILITY,"STUDENTS PERCEPTIONS OF ABILITY   The present study investigated ability perceptions of 29 intellectually gifted students in the mainstream and 71 average achievers. The Perception of Ability Scale for Students (PASS: formerly the Student's Perception of Ability Scale) was used to assess ability perceptions on three occasions over two years. The results indicated that gifted students held significantly higher ability perceptions in all areas tapped by the PASS except School Satisfaction and Penmanship/Neatness. In general, perceptions of ability were stable for both groups across the two years, although a decline in school satisfaction was noted for both groups. The results suggest that ability perceptions become stable as patterns of performance become stable."

This article describes and evaluates a pilot enrichment program designed to meet their needs. Seven bright learning disabled youngsters in grades 4 and 5 met for 2½ hours a week over a nine-month period to develop their strengths and interests through challenging enrichment activities. Six of the seven students showed gains in self-esteem, learning behavior, and creative productivity."

Some promising solutions to these problems are suggested. Included are non-traditional identification procedures, computer and video linkages between school systems, cooperative personnel development, and sharing of special service staffs for the gifted."
1019,1987.0,THE GIFTED LEARNING-DISABLED STUDENT,"THE GIFTED LEARNING-DISABLED STUDENT   As the identification of learning disabled and gifted students becomes more sophisticated, there appears to be a growing number of students who fit both categories. This article discusses the identification of learning disabled and gifted students as well as the characteristics of a group which has gotten little attention, the gifted/LD. The ways in which gifted/learning disabled students are presently missed by educational systems as well as procedures to help insure identification of this group are also covered."
1020,1987.0,THE EARLY DEVELOPMENT OF PRECOCITY,"THE EARLY DEVELOPMENT OF PRECOCITY   The time is ripe for extending our interest in gifted children downward to infancy and preschool. Existing research is reviewed, and a plea made for extending work in the following areas: (1) identification and description, (2) prediction from early behavior to (similar or dissimilar) later attainments, (3) studies of the origins of commitment and high achievement motivation, (4) naturalistic and experimental studies of the nurturance of exceptional abilities. Gifted babies and toddlers are compelling both in their own right and for what they can tell us about the emergence of individual differences."
1021,1987.0,A DEVELOPMENTAL VIEW OF GIFTEDNESS,A DEVELOPMENTAL VIEW OF GIFTEDNESS   Our most precious resources for the future of our society are human resources. We made an important commitment of scientific talent and financial support about 25 years ago to enhancing the developmental potential of the retarded among us. The progress in this area has been gratifying. A concomitant commitment has not been made to understanding the developmental potential of the gifted among us. The time is past due for that commitment. It is important to draw out the developmental issues related to the gifted and the talented in such a way as to frame productive scientific questions. The model presented in this essay has been used to frame such a set of questions.
1022,1987.0,A 3-YEAR STUDY OF THE EFFECTS OF LOW INCOME ON SAT SCORES AMONG THE ACADEMICALLY ABLE,A 3-YEAR STUDY OF THE EFFECTS OF LOW INCOME ON SAT SCORES AMONG THE ACADEMICALLY ABLE   This study reports on the incidence of economically disadvantaged gifted learners in the midwest and the differential effects of low income on their SAT scores when compared to higher income students. It presents data supporting the conclusion that low income impedes the gifted student from being able to take advantage of special programs outside of his or her school district and negatively affects test scores even in the upper ranges of ability. Ideas for combating the differential scoring pattern of low income students are discussed along with implications for school district and state policy development.
1023,1987.0,BRINGING OUT HEAD-START TALENTS - FINDINGS FROM THE FIELD,"BRINGING OUT HEAD-START TALENTS - FINDINGS FROM THE FIELD   The purpose of this project was to address the need for identifying and providing programming for potentially gifted Head Start children. Four hundred forty-six Head Start children, 32 teachers, and 32 teacher aides participated in the field-testing and were divided into intervention and comparison groups. The comparison group was made up of 212 children, 20 teachers, and 20 teacher aides, and the intervention group included 234 children, 12 teachers, and 12 teacher aides. All children in both groups received programming to enhance divergent, convergent, and evaluative thinking skills. Children with special gifts and talents in both groups were identified and those in the intervention group received programming in their talent area. Results indicated that both indentified and non-identified potentially gifted children in the intervention group made significant gains over the comparison group in cognitive and creative functioning. In addition, attitudes of teachers in the intervention group toward their classes became significantly more positive than attitudes of teachers in the comparison group."
1024,1987.0,"IM BLACK BUT LOOK AT ME, I AM ALSO GIFTED","IM BLACK BUT LOOK AT ME, I AM ALSO GIFTED   The lack of representation of black gifted children in educational programs for the gifted is a cause for great concem. Historical precedents and lack of empirical data on appropriate identification processes and educational planning techniques have been noted as part of the reason for the lack. A discussion of research data to date indicates that observation techniques, community involvement, and peer, parent, and teacher nominations are viable techniques to use in identifying the black gifted child. The data also show that leadership skills, creativity, and mental processing abilities, are good indicators of giftedness among the black students. Identification, curriculum, the instructional environment (teacher, setting, strategies), and evaluation are discussed as important aspects of a total plan for the black gifted child. Alternatives for program planning are recommended."

Yet, fear of possible negative effects of acceleration prevents many educators from advocating these options. The Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth (SMPY) has evaluated the long-term effects of a variety of accelerative options for a group of highly gifted students. Academic achievements, extracurricular activities, goals and aspirations, and social and emotional adjustment were considered, and no discernible negative effects of various accelerative strategies were found."

The findings illustrate the efficiency of science content mastery in the context of scientific inquiry, the relative difficulty of demonstrating growth in scientific inquiry per se over a short period of time, and the affective changes that occur in attitudes toward science as a result of such a program. Implications for implementing such programs in local settings are discussed."

In spring 1984, the authors offered their first directory of graduate degree programs in gifted education. Recent requests from state directors, psychologists, university faculty, prospective graduate students, and others have indicated a need for an update of this information. The current search revealed that 134 colleges and universities in 42 states and the District of Columbia offered such programs. All reported programs are listed in the 1986-87 directory, along with the appropriate contact persons and their addresses."

The results of the Advanced Placement Examinations associated with this component of the Duke Program suggest that By-Mail courses provide intellectual stimulation for brilliant middle school youth, prepare them for college credit exams, and can serve as a vehicle to assist school systems in meeting the educational needs of academically talented youngsters."
1032,1987.0,THE GENERALITY OF CREATIVE PERFORMANCE IN GIFTED AND NONGIFTED CHILDREN,"THE GENERALITY OF CREATIVE PERFORMANCE IN GIFTED AND NONGIFTED CHILDREN   In order to evaluate the generality of creativity, gifted and nongifted children (N = 228) were given a creative performance questionnaire. Questionnaires were scored for quality and quantity in seven performance domains: writing, music, crafts, art, science, performing arts, and public presentation. The generality of performance was tested by checking the intercorrelations of the seven domains. Results indicated that the quality and quantity of creative performance were largely unrelated, and differences between gifted and nongifted children were slight. Additionally, for both gifted and nongifted children, quantity performance scores of the seven domains were significantly correlated (median r= .46), and quality performance scores were only weakly correlated (median r=.16)."
1033,1987.0,THE STABILITY OF ORIGINAL THINKING IN YOUNG-CHILDREN,"THE STABILITY OF ORIGINAL THINKING IN YOUNG-CHILDREN   Findings from the longitudinal study demonstrate that original thinking in young children (N = 33, 75 to 98 mo.) is relatively stable between 4 and ages 7 and 8. The stability of original thinking (r = .54) was comparable to the stability of 1Q ( r # .44) over the same period of time. Original thinking defined as the ability to generate unusual ideas was shown to be distinct from intelligence as measured by the Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children-Revised. An order effect in the response sequence such that popular responses occur early and original later, reported in an earlier study with young children, was also replicated."

Factor analysis conducted on a sample of children identified as ""gifted"" yielded a four-factor solution accounting for approximately 65% of the total variance: Perceptual Organization, Verbal Comprehension, Acquisition of Knowledge, and Spatial Memory. Analyses of groups of children with average and above average intelligence scores revealed two- and three-factor solutions for the average children, but a pattern similar to the gifted child for the high IQ group. Results suggest that gifted children process information in a qualitatively different manner from average children."

The young college students earned higher grades, more academic honors, and participated in more extracurrcular activities. They graduated and entered the professions earlier, and were, in 1940, more often rated as ""high achievers,"" although this qualitative difference had disappeared by 1960. No differences in psychosocial adjustment were discovered."
1040,1987.0,FAMILY ENVIRONMENT AND PERSONALITY ADJUSTMENT IN GIFTED PROGRAM CHILDREN,"FAMILY ENVIRONMENT AND PERSONALITY ADJUSTMENT IN GIFTED PROGRAM CHILDREN   While many studies have investigated family characteristics that distinguish children with gifted-level abili- ties from other children, less attention has been given to family characteristics that are associated with personality adjustment within the gifted- level poupulation. This study addresses the question of which aspects of the family environmentare are significantly correlated with healthy personality adjustment among a group of children already identified as gifted. Each of the 10 scales contained in the widely used Family Environment Scales (Moos & Moos, 1981) was correlated with personality adjustment scores of 83 children, ages 7 to 11, who were attending either a public or private school gifted program. Personality adjustment was assessed by parent, child, and teacher report measures. Findings suggest that mutually supportive and open family relationships are more important to the child's self- esteem and overall adjustment that are specific family activities or value orientations."
1041,1987.0,PERSONALITY-TRAITS AND CHILDHOOD ENVIRONMENTS OF EMINENT ESSAYISTS,"PERSONALITY-TRAITS AND CHILDHOOD ENVIRONMENTS OF EMINENT ESSAYISTS   The goal of the research was to define conditions of excellence by an historical analysis of the psychological traits and childhood environments of eminent essayists of history. A sample of 42 foremost essayists, historians, and critics was used. The sample was derived from earlier work on eminence by Cattell (1903) and Terman (1925). Encyclopaedia Britannica biographers and other researchers rated a list of traits and conditions concerning cognitive, affective, familiar, and educational aspect of the sample. The results of Chi-square tests of significance focus on the degree of persistence of the traits and conditions and suggest that while intelligence is a component of eminence, environmental influences are substantial. Familial, school, and social conditions reticulated an indispensable support during the childhoods of the future essayists. Educators and parents have a responsibility to provide the conditions that foster excellence."
1042,1987.0,"REACTIONS TO FAILURE AND SUCCESS AMONG GIFTED, AVERAGE, AND EMR STUDENTS","REACTIONS TO FAILURE AND SUCCESS AMONG GIFTED, AVERAGE, AND EMR STUDENTS   This investigation was designed to examine the reactions of gifted students, and to a lesser extent, those of average and EMR students, to success and failure in the school setting. Attributions, persistence of effort following a failure, willingness to attempt a task following failure, as well as future expectations for success were explored. Students were assessed in two conditions in which success and failure were manipulated. Results indicated that gifted students did not credit success to ability as predicted, but instead to a low level of task difficulty. The expectations of gifted students were very high initially, but considereably lower following a failure, as were those of the average and EMR groups. Gifted students showed more persistence in regard to the difficult task than EMR students and also chose more often to repeat the difficult task."

The results of the study show that the long-term effects of the gifted label are in part a reverse of the reported immediate effects. Research on immediate effects indicates difficulties for non-labeled siblings. Long-term effects indicate that siblings ""came to terms"" with the label and did not seem to harbor negative feelings or recollections. While the families reported an overall positive attitude towards the gifted member, it was the gifted member who seemed less certain of the positive feelings of siblings and parents regarding the label."

Additional personality and behavioral information on each child was provided by his/her mother and teacher. Giftedness seemed to be an advantage for girls but not for boys. Gifted girls described themselves as having a more positive self-concept and a more internal locus of control than did non-gifted girls. No such differences were found with boys. In fact, gifted boys gave some evidence of lower self-satisfaction, particularly in areas of physical strength and aggressiveness, when compared to non-gifted boys. Mothers and teachers similarly reported fewer problem areas for gifted girls but no such differences between gifted and non-gifted boys. The findings are discussed in the context of cultural sex-role expectations."
1052,1987.0,INSERVICE AND PRESERVICE TEACHERS ATTITUDES TOWARD THE ACADEMICALLY BRILLIANT,"INSERVICE AND PRESERVICE TEACHERS ATTITUDES TOWARD THE ACADEMICALLY BRILLIANT   Attitudes toward the academically gifted were examined in 83 experienced teachers and 100 juniors and seniors enrolled in a teacher education program. Using a questionnaire developed by Tannenbaum (1962), the characteristics of athleticism, diligence, and academic brilliance were examined as they affected perceptions of hypothetical high school students. Attitude correlates were defined as scholastic achievement, sex, and previous teaching experience of the rater. Results indicated that experienced teachers and future teachers, like the high school students in Tannenbaum's study, viewed athleticism as the critical determinant of a person's likability."

1055,1987.0,USING JUDGMENT ANALYSIS IN THE IDENTIFICATION OF GIFTED AND TALENTED CHILDREN,"USING JUDGMENT ANALYSIS IN THE IDENTIFICATION OF GIFTED AND TALENTED CHILDREN   When multiple criteria are used to identify gifted and talented students personnel responsible for identification are often unaware of the weighting scheme they have chosen to use. If some kind of weighting scheme is chosen in order to reflect relative importance of criteria, the statistical properties of the combination of criteria and weights can lead to rankings of students which do not reflect the philosophy ofthose creating the weighting system. The method of Judgment Analysis (JAN) can be used to determine a weighting system which reflects an identification philosophy accurately."

The model incorporates the principal features of the individual case study approach, the part-time learning center, and individualized independent study in the regular class. The results of the program indicated several aspects of teaching provisions which were necessary for successful implementation of the model. Also considered were the effects of the program on the parents and the children's social relations with age peers."
1057,1987.0,"METACOGNITION, INTELLIGENCE AND GIFTEDNESS","METACOGNITION, INTELLIGENCE AND GIFTEDNESS   The contribution of metacognition to the better understanding of giftedness is explored in the context of the ""triarchic"" theory of intelligence and its subtheory of insight proposed by Sternberg and his colleagues at Yale University, and in relation to research into the interaction between availability and flexibility of cognitive style on one hand, and metacognitive knowledge and skill on the other. Support is offered for the importance of interactions among the elements (meta-components, performance components, and knowledge-acquisition components) of the triarchic theory to better explain giftedness. Finally, rather than regarding a theory of giftedness to be a subtheory of one of intelligence, might there be merit in considering the opposite order?"

Ninety-eight fifth and sixth graders enrolled in programs for creatively and intellectually gifted children participated in the study. Metamemory and divergent thinking were found to be related; this cor-IQ was removed. Metamemory also correlated with achievement but not with IQ. A canonical correlation and divergent thinking and metamemory as the independent measures indicated that metamemory and achievement were the major contributors to the equation. The concept of metamemory is an important process that appears independent from, yet essential for, convergent and divergent thinking and that may underlie creative achievements."

This is a serious problem because of the popularity of these tests, and because divergent thinking is probably our most useful model of creative thinking. Still, the research demonstrating a lack of discriminant validity was conducted primarily with nongifted subjects, and the findings may not apply to gifted individuals. The present project evaluated the discriminant validity of gifted children's (N = 97) divergent thinking test scores with multitrait-multimethod and factor analytic procedures. Results indicated that the indices drawn from the divergent thinking tests did lack discriminant validity in this gifted sample."

Mathematically gifted boys (n = 77) and girls (n = 62) completed a mathematics reasoning test (SAT-M), a verbal reasoning test (SAT-V), a measure of spatial ability (Group Embedded Figures Test), and personality test (California Psychological Inventory). They received mathematics achievement ratings depending on the number of summer courses completed. The findings indicated that boys not only have higher mathematical reasoning ability than girls, but alslo that this ability is the single best predictor of their mathematical achievement.

1099,1986.0,THE LEGACY AND LOGIC OF RESEARCH ON THE IDENTIFICATION OF GIFTED PERSONS,"THE LEGACY AND LOGIC OF RESEARCH ON THE IDENTIFICATION OF GIFTED PERSONS   Are we identifying the ""truly gifted"" student? How should we test the efficacy of our procedures? The authors assess research on the topics of defining and identifying exceptional potential. They propose three alternative criteria to intelligence test scores as the key criterion for identification."
1100,1986.0,COGNITION AND GIFTEDNESS - NEW RESEARCH DIRECTIONS,"COGNITION AND GIFTEDNESS - NEW RESEARCH DIRECTIONS   How do gifted students think? Are their thinking processes significantly different from their nonidentified peers? The author explores issues related to theory, methods and validity of cognition research. New developments are previewed, and suggestions made for further investigations."
1101,1986.0,PROTOCOL ANALYSIS - A METHODOLOGY FOR EXPLORING THE INFORMATION-PROCESSING OF GIFTED STUDENTS,"PROTOCOL ANALYSIS - A METHODOLOGY FOR EXPLORING THE INFORMATION-PROCESSING OF GIFTED STUDENTS   Paper-and-pencil tests yield little information relative to thinking strategies used by gifted students to solve problems. Protocal analysis, argues the author, provides a ""window"" into the mental operations used by gifted learners. The method is described, and results of recent work highlighted. Implications for additional research are discussed."
1102,1986.0,THE APPLICATION OF SINGLE SUBJECT RESEARCH METHODS TO THE STUDY OF EXCEPTIONAL ABILITY AND EXTRAORDINARY ACHIEVEMENT,"THE APPLICATION OF SINGLE SUBJECT RESEARCH METHODS TO THE STUDY OF EXCEPTIONAL ABILITY AND EXTRAORDINARY ACHIEVEMENT   The author presents a convincing case that large-scale studies do not necessarily yield useful information for describing the phenomenon we call giftedness, or for identifying related cause-and-effect factors. Alternatives for studying gifted indivduals using methods such as case studies and single subject designs are explored and discussed."

All Talent Pool students and other interested students in grades five through eight were provided with a series of interest development activities in astronomy. Follow-up discussions and interest assessment procedures identified ten students who expressed a desire to pursue further training in this content area. Students were provided with binoculars, telescopes, and a self-instructional unit that would allow them to carry out their work at home during the evening hours. Parent participation and involvement were encouraged. A questionnaire and astronomy skills assessment scale were administered at the beginning and the conclusion of each student's observational and data-gathering activities. Results indicated moderate to considerable amounts of growth in most of the specific skills that were targeted in the self-instructional unit. Increased interest in astronomy was expressed by most of the students and one-half of the group elected to pursue their own advanced level investigations in astronomical research. Parent evaluations were extremely positive, and even those students who did not elect to pursue advanced research expressed favorable attitudes about the experience including increased self-confidence, and the development of positive study skills."

The research developed in two major phases; phase one suggested hypotheses and properties which were revised, tested, and verified in the second phase. A theoretical model of the roles of the teacher of the gifted is presented and possible applications of the research are suggested."
1108,1985.0,PREFERENCES OF GIFTED STUDENTS FOR SELECTED TEACHER CHARACTERISTICS,"PREFERENCES OF GIFTED STUDENTS FOR SELECTED TEACHER CHARACTERISTICS   Gifted children in grades 7-9 (N = 98) judged the importance of selected teacher characteristics in personal-social, cognitive, and classroom management domains. Subjects were enrolled in a gifted program in a large junior high school in West Texas. Gifted children were found to prefer personal-social characteristics over cognitive or classroom management characteristics. Results were compared to findings of a similar study conducted in Israel in which cognitive characteristics were found to be most highly valued."
1109,1985.0,GIFTED-CHILDREN AND OTHER SIBLINGS,"GIFTED-CHILDREN AND OTHER SIBLINGS   This study examined sibling relationships within families where only one of two children had been labeled gifted. Twenty-seven pairs of labeled/unlabeled siblings completed a forced-choice questionnaire investigating the sibling relationship. Responses were analyzed according to label, sex, sibling position, and age gap. The area of competition was perceived differently by labeled and unlabeled siblings. Competition appeared to be beneficial to the self-image of labeled children, encouraging cooperation and communication. For unlabeled children competition had negative effects inhibiting cooperation and damaging the sibling relationship.Both labeled and unlabeled siblings perceived more friction if the gifted child was the oldest."
1110,1985.0,EARLY IDENTIFICATION OF THE GIFTED AND TALENTED,"EARLY IDENTIFICATION OF THE GIFTED AND TALENTED   Given the recognized importance of early identification of and educational intervention for the gifted and talented, the present study examined the predictive validity of the STAR (Screening Test for Academic Readiness) as well as decision-making accuracy that could be expected if the STAR were used as one screening tool in the identification process. For a sample of 74 students referred for assessment, 28 of whom were ultimately placed in gifted and talented programs and 46 of whom failed to qualify for special educational placement, the results of the regression analysis indicated that prekindergarten STAR scores significantly predicted WISC-R Verbal, Performance, and Full Scale IQ scores obtained several years later. From a decision-making standpoint, the results indicated that a 72% accuracy rate would have resulted had later placement of students been based upon prekindergarten STAR scores alone."
1111,1985.0,THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LEARNING STYLE PREFERENCE AND PERSONALITY-VARIABLES - AN EXPLORATORY INVESTIGATION WITH GIFTED STUDENTS,"THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LEARNING STYLE PREFERENCE AND PERSONALITY-VARIABLES - AN EXPLORATORY INVESTIGATION WITH GIFTED STUDENTS   The relationship between the Children's Personality Questionnaire (CPQ) and the Your Style of Learning and Thinking (SOLAT) was examined for 94 intellectually gifted students aged 9 to 14 years. Groups formed based on SOLAT scores were: (a) Right, (b) Left, (c) Integrated, and (d) Mixed. Discriminant functions derived from all CPQ factors yielded three functions. One discriminant function which can be described as an action dimension was significant. A classification analysis yielded 61.7% correct classification. These results indicate that there is a relationship between personality variables and preference for a particular style of information processing."
1112,1985.0,THE PERFORMANCE OF STUDENTS IN A PROGRAM OF RADICAL ACCELERATION AT THE UNIVERSITY LEVEL,"THE PERFORMANCE OF STUDENTS IN A PROGRAM OF RADICAL ACCELERATION AT THE UNIVERSITY LEVEL   The academic performance of 24 academically accelerated students (mean age at matriculation = 14 years) was compared with that of two groups of college students averaging four years older: 24 matched to the accelerants on pre-entry academic aptitude test scores (or ""readiness""), and 24 National Merit Scholars. Accelerated students earned cumulative grade point averages comparable to those earned by National Merit Scholars and significantly higher than those earned by university students matched on pre-entry aptitude tests scores. Accelerated students rated the importance of academic characteristics higher than did the students matched on pre-entry scores and they were more satisfied with the academic environment of the university than either comparison group. Implications of the results are briefly discussed."

When presented with externally provided learning strategies, however, the learning of gifted students can dramatically increase. Of particular interest is the ""keyword"" mnemonic strategy which has recently been seen to provide substantial increases in learning for gifted learners. Implications for teaching and programming are presented."
1115,1985.0,GIFTEDNESS AND READING - A CROSS-SECTIONAL VIEW OF DIFFERENCES IN READING ATTITUDES AND BEHAVIORS,"GIFTEDNESS AND READING - A CROSS-SECTIONAL VIEW OF DIFFERENCES IN READING ATTITUDES AND BEHAVIORS   This study investigated the attitude toward reading and the self-reported reading behaviors of 276 gifted students in grades 1 through 12. Females had more positive attitudes toward reading and reported that reading was a hobby more frequently than males. Primary students had more positive attitudes toward reading than did senior high students. Primary students reported reading more books per month than intermediate level, junior high school, and senior high school students. Senior high school students reported reading the least number of books per month."
1116,1985.0,GIFTEDNESS AND TALENT - REEXAMINING A REEXAMINATION OF THE DEFINITIONS,"GIFTEDNESS AND TALENT - REEXAMINING A REEXAMINATION OF THE DEFINITIONS   In the scientific literature, there is ambiguity in the distinction between the concepts of giftedness and talent. This paper examines several common definitions of these two terms, with particular emphasis on the models proposed by Renzulli (1979) and Cohn (1981). Our critique of these two models leads to a clear differentiation between giftedness and talent: the former is associated with domains of abilities which foster and explain exceptional performance in varied fields of activities, that is, talents. Thus, one can be gifted without necessarily being talented (as with the case of underachievers), but not vice versa. Several factors which can act as catalysts for the actualization of giftedness in specific talents are discussed, particularly motivation and environmental quality."
1117,1985.0,PSYCHOMETRIC LIMITATIONS OF GUILFORD STRUCTURE-OF-INTELLECT MODEL FOR IDENTIFICATION AND PROGRAMMING OF THE GIFTED,"PSYCHOMETRIC LIMITATIONS OF GUILFORD STRUCTURE-OF-INTELLECT MODEL FOR IDENTIFICATION AND PROGRAMMING OF THE GIFTED   The purpose of this presentation is (a) to analyze critically reseach and promotional literature on Guilford's Structure-of-Intellect (SOI) model as it relates to the cognitive functioning of gifted students, and (b) to evaluate the implications of this analysis for the identification and programming of gifted students. This evaluation is based on a review of promotional literature and available research, and is written from a measurement basis. It is concluded that the promotional literature promises more than it has delivered and that major psychometric limitations seriously limit the SOI model's usefulness."

1119,1985.0,DIMENSIONS OF ANXIETY AMONG HIGH IQ CHILDREN,"DIMENSIONS OF ANXIETY AMONG HIGH IQ CHILDREN   Responses of 584 high IQ children to the 37 item Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale were submitted to a factor analysis. The five factors that emerged (Physiological, Worry/Oversensitivity, Concentration, Lie 1, and Lie 2) were shown to be highly similar to the factors found with the normative sample. Coefficients of congruence revealed significant correspondence between all factors for the high IQ and normative group. Means and standard deviations for males and females at each age group are also reported, revealing lower levels of anxiety for the high IQ group on all variables. Reliability estimates for each age group on the three subscales of anxiety and for the total Anxiety Scale support the clinical and research use of this new scale in work with high IQ children."
1120,1985.0,THE EFFECT OF APTITUDE AND ACHIEVEMENT STATUS ON THE SELF-SYSTEM,"THE EFFECT OF APTITUDE AND ACHIEVEMENT STATUS ON THE SELF-SYSTEM   This investigation examined the independent and joint effects of aptitude (gifted vs. normal) and achievement (underachiever vs. achiever) on assessments of the self-system in upper elementary-aged children. The gifted group was significantly higher than the average group on self-evaluations of competence, feelings of mastery, and preference for independent decision making. The average group reported a lower level of understanding than the gifted group about the reasons for success and failure outcomes and more anxiety about school-related events. Underachievers were significantly lower than achievers on self-evaluations of performance and higher on perceptions of internal control over success and failure outcomes. Achievers were higher on perceptions of control by powerful others over outcomes."

The list of benefits was developed from the literature on mentorships, from interviews with mentors and proteges, and from an evaluation completed by gifted students and their mentors at the termination of a school mentorship program. Gifts to proteges include: advancement of career, an increase in knowledge and skills (general as well as specific), development of known as well as undiscovered talents, development of a personal ethic, establishment of a friendship, and enhancement of creativity. Also described are the following gifts to mentors: getting work done, having ideation stimulated, establishing a long-term friendship, and receiving personal satisfaction. Implications for educators of the gifted and talented focus on program development."
1125,1985.0,A CHILD BY ANY OTHER NAME - A COMPARISON OF THE PLAYFULNESS OF GIFTED AND NONGIFTED CHILDREN,"A CHILD BY ANY OTHER NAME - A COMPARISON OF THE PLAYFULNESS OF GIFTED AND NONGIFTED CHILDREN   Fifteen preschool children, designated gifted by standard intelligence testing procedures, were matched with a nongifted preschool sample. The children were observed and rated on the degree of composite playfulness they established as well as on five constituent play dimensions. Results indicated the gifted children demonstrated higher degrees of physical, social, and cognitive play styles but were equivalent to the nongifted group in sense of humor and manifest joy. Significant sex differences were also obtained, with boys demonstrating more physical exuberance, active play patterns, teasing and joking during play, and less variety. Findings were discussed as they reflect on developmental changes through childhood and point to accelerated distributions for gifted children."
1126,1985.0,ETHNOGRAPHY OF A PRESCHOOL FOR THE GIFTED - WHAT GIFTED YOUNG-CHILDREN ACTUALLY DO,"ETHNOGRAPHY OF A PRESCHOOL FOR THE GIFTED - WHAT GIFTED YOUNG-CHILDREN ACTUALLY DO   An analysis of naturalistic observations of children attending a preschool for the gifted suggests that young gifted children behave in a manner similar to unselected preschool children. However, gifted preschoolers frequently demonstrate advanced knowledge, thinking abilities, creativity, and social maturity. Other observed behaviors include competitiveness, independence, and persistence in task completion. These descriptions of young gifted children as a group should be tempered by the finding that many individual differences exist. The results of this study suggest several implications for preschool programs for the gifted."

Group administrations were conducted in two schools differing in the probable socioeconomic status (SES) of their pupils. Scores increased with grade level and were greater in the higher SES school, though the latter difference accounted for a much smaller proportion of the variance. It was concluded that the PEPSI is usable with most Grade 2 to Grade 6 pupils at both lower and middle socioeconomic levels, and has potential utility in teaching problem-solving skills to gifted children."
1128,1985.0,PREDICTORS OF LONELINESS IN THE GIFTED ADOLESCENT,"PREDICTORS OF LONELINESS IN THE GIFTED ADOLESCENT   Gifted adolescents reported degree of loneliness to be a function of anger, depression, and stressful life changes. Furthermore, the most salient aspects of depression for predicting loneliness were helplessness, social introversion, and low self-esteem. The relationship between loneliness and depression suggests further evidence of a possible success depression in certain gifted adolescents. The results help to clarify the complex relationship between loneliness and other dysphoric states in these youths."

Eighty-eight children (37%) conceptualized themselves as differing from their peers. Although they described differences in a positive fashion, and although their self-esteem was above the mean reported for a large normative sample, it was lower than that of high-IQ children who did not think of themselves as being different. Furthermore, the reports about peer relations given by children who thought themselves different contained more signs suggesting difficulties than did those of children who did not. These results suggest that many cognitively gifted children need increased psychological support if they are to optimize their personal and social development."

He relieved his depression by resolving for himself the dilemma that continues to face the exceptionally able students of today: the choice between unfettered intellectual development or the inevitable biasing that results from being taught by another. And of the many interests competing for control of the individual's education and development, it is only the individual who must resolve this dilemma that has no legally enforceable final say."

They maintain that evaluation of gifted programs should be formative, as opposed to summative, because gifted programming serves a valuable social need. The authors describe the process that evaluators go through to conduct a program evaluation, and then present their program evaluation model. Two approaches are integrated in their model. First, process-oriented evaluation defines essential program components and standards of acceptance. Second, outcome-oriented evaluation assesses components via student outcomes. Both approaches are described and suggestions are given for their use."

A wide range of difficulty and interest levels was found among the 13 texts. Subject matter coverage was also analyzed and charted. A wide variety of topics was found, with little agreement among authors concerning appropriate subject matter. Some important topics, such as career educational planning, received surprisingly little coverage. Some books were found to be lacking important sections, such as author or subject indices."
1138,1985.0,AN EMPIRICAL-COMPARISON OF 2 PROGRAM MODELS FOR ELEMENTARY GIFTED EDUCATION,"AN EMPIRICAL-COMPARISON OF 2 PROGRAM MODELS FOR ELEMENTARY GIFTED EDUCATION   The purpose of this study was to develop a gifted program that could be used by regular classroom teachers and to compare the cognitive achievement outcomes of gifted students in this new program with similar students in a program taught by a teacher specialist in gifted education. Results indicated that an effective gifted education program for use by regular classroom teachers could be devised. Additionally, when regular classroom teachers used this program, which was characterized by clearly defined and articulated objectives, adequate teacher inservice and monitoring activities, a direct instruction component, and a rigorous evaluation system, they produced the same cognitive gains as teacher ""gifted"" specialists."

Based on the characteristic of gifted children to master content quickly and on the needs of the classroom teacher to provide differentiated instruction in the content areas, the institute emphasized the role of the content specialist. Although no control group was used, the highly significant gain from pre- to posttest suggests the institute curriculum was effective. Finally, additional evaluation data indicate the institute was well received by teachers."
1140,1985.0,ARE TEACHERS OF THE GIFTED SPECIALISTS - A LANDMARK DECISION ON EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES IN SPECIAL-EDUCATION FOR THE GIFTED,"ARE TEACHERS OF THE GIFTED SPECIALISTS - A LANDMARK DECISION ON EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES IN SPECIAL-EDUCATION FOR THE GIFTED   The relative newness of many gifted education programs and the lack of certification regulations sometimes means that teachers of the gifted must face employment insecurities that result from their lack of seniority in new instructional situations. Threatened with the termination of her teaching contract during a period of declining enrollment, a five-year gifted specialist became embroiled in a grievance procedure to determine her fitness for employment in preference to a tenured senior classroom teacher who did not have special training. Adjudication hearings involved both teachers, the Board of Education, and the American Arbitration Association. At issue were many factors that could have far reaching impact for teachers of the gifted and the field at large."
1141,1985.0,ATTRIBUTES OF EXCELLENCE IN VARIOUS PROFESSIONS - THEIR RELEVANCE TO THE SELECTION OF GIFTED TALENTED PERSONS,"ATTRIBUTES OF EXCELLENCE IN VARIOUS PROFESSIONS - THEIR RELEVANCE TO THE SELECTION OF GIFTED TALENTED PERSONS   Grades will predict grades and the academic-type tests will predict grades but they have been found through research studies to be poor predictors or no predictors at all of who will be the best in professions. The troublesome answer generally is that professional schools do not select the persons who will become the best professionals in their fields, nor who will best keep up-to-date with new knowledge and techniques in their careers. The main exception to this general finding occurs in the field of professional athletics and in the entertainment and artistic fields. The example given comes from the Dallas Cowboys scouting data and outcome of potential football recruits in their professional careers. Their correlations are about .70 with career success, whereas predictors from professional schools range from zeros to about +.20 or slightly higher—such predictors from professional schools still miss over 90% or even over 95% of the target, i.e., what is involved in succeeding in each of the professions. Con sequently, neither those chosen into most professions nor their future clients will be well served by such poor predictive procedures."
