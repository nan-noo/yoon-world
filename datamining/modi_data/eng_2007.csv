"Sorting the wheat from the chaff: What makes for good evidence of effectiveness in the literature in gifted education? research quality; meta-analyses; judging evidence To provide an overview of the specific components that must be considered when making decisions about research in the field of gifted education, the authors describe and evaluate the three types of evidence-speculative or anecdotal, theoretical, and empirical-commonly offered in the literature of the field. Empirical, or evidence-based, research can be quantitative or qualitative (or mixed methods); it also can be interventional or non-interventional. An explanation and example of each type of empirical evidence are provided, along with key guidelines for reviewing and judging each one. Next, the authors offer general considerations for evaluating specific components of research, regardless of the type of study (e.g., source of evidence, research design, research questions, effect size, sample, instrumentation). Considerations for judging meta-analyses are also offered.",329.0,Sorting the wheat from the chaff: What makes for good evidence of effectiveness in the literature in gifted education?,2007.0
"The talent search model: Past, present, and future talent search; above-level testing; academic acceleration; ceiling effect; DT -> PI model Typical standardized achievement tests cannot provide accurate information about gifted students' abilities because they are not challenging enough for such students. Talent searches solve this problem through above-level testing-using tests designed for older students to raise the ceiling for younger, gifted students. Currently, talent search pro-rams serve gifted students from grades 2 through 8 throughout the mainland United States and in several foreign countries. Extensive research demonstrates that above-level test scores differentiate among levels of giftedness and have important implications for educational planning. Students with high scores learn advanced material rapidly and well and thrive in accelerated learning settings. Therefore, talent searches have followed up on testing with educational programs, many of which focus on acceleration. Decades of research have documented both academic and psychosocial benefits to participants. Perhaps the greatest challenge ahead of the talent searches is that of facilitating the appropriate education of gifted students in the school setting.",330.0,"The talent search model: Past, present, and future",2007.0
"The socioaffective impact of acceleration and ability grouping: Recommendations for best practice peer ability grouping; social; emotional; acceleration Although the academic gains associated with acceleration and peer ability grouping are well documented, resistance to their use for gifted students continues because of concerns that such practices will cause social or emotional harm to students. Results from the broad research indicate that grade skipping, early school entrance, and early admission to college have socioaffective benefits for gifted students who are selected on the basis of demonstrated academic, social, and emotional maturity, but may be harmful to unselected students who are arbitrarily accelerated on the basis of IQ, achievement, or social maturity. There is little research on the socioaffective effects of peer ability grouping. The limited evidence indicates strong benefits for highly gifted students and possibly for some minority or disadvantaged gifted students. Robust evidence does not exist to support the idea that heterogeneous classroom grouping per se significantly increases the risk for adjustment problems among moderately gifted students. Recommendations for best practice based on the available evidence are presented.",331.0,The socioaffective impact of acceleration and ability grouping: Recommendations for best practice,2007.0
"Toward best practice: An analysis of the efficacy of curriculum models in gifted education curriculum models; research-based evidence of effectiveness; differentiated curriculum for the gifted This article provides an overview of existing research on I I curriculum models in the field of gifted education, including the schoolwide enrichment model and the talent search model, and several others that have been used to shape high-level learning experiences for gifted students. The models are critiqued according to the key features they contribute to student learning, teacher use, and contextual fit, including alignment to standards and use with special populations of gifted and nongifted learners. The authors also provide a set of key principles derived from the research studies on what has been learned as a field about curriculum and instruction for the gifted. The article concludes with a set of practical considerations for educators in implementing any of the curricula analyzed and specific district applications of the Integrated Curriculum Model (ICM) that illustrate effective implementation over time.",332.0,Toward best practice: An analysis of the efficacy of curriculum models in gifted education,2007.0
"Cognitive and affective learning outcomes of gifted elementary school students components of gifted programs; outcomes of gifted programs This project was a 2-year investigation of elementary school children placed in programs for high-ability learners. The primary purpose of the study was to investigate academic and affective changes in students during their first 2 years in a gifted program. Students were assessed during the fall of one year and the spring of the next year. Subjects were from 14 different school districts in 10 states and included African American and Caucasian/non-Hispanic students. The study compared students enrolled in gifted programs (special school, separate class, pull-out, within-class), high-achieving students from districts in which no program was available at the designated grade levels, and nongifted students in regular classrooms. This project focused on academic and affective student outcomes through multiple administrations of an achievement test, a self-perception survey, and a motivation inventory. In addition to comparing programs in general, an important dimension of the project was to examine characteristics of students from traditionally underserved populations. This was accomplished by including the variables of racial/ethnic status and the social status of participants. Results revealed that there were differences in cognitive and affective outcomes across program types. Therefore, it is strongly advised that educators conduct ongoing evaluations of their programs to be better able to monitor and address all students' needs.",333.0,Cognitive and affective learning outcomes of gifted elementary school students,2007.0
"Lessons learned about educating the gifted and talented: A synthesis of the research on educational practice grouping; acceleration; instructional management; talent development This article discusses five reconsiderations (lessons) the research on the education of the gifted and talented suggests. Although several of the considerations derive from traditional practice in the field, some reconsideration is warranted because of more currently researched differences in how the gifted learner intellectually functions. It is argued that thinking of the gifted learner as idiosyncratic, not necessarily one of many classified as the gifted, requires a reconceptualization of how to appropriately and fully serve this unique learner. The research synthesized here covers the period from 1861 to present and represents the entire body of published research studies and representative literature (theory, program descriptions, and persuasive essays). Implications for service development and implementation are also discussed.",334.0,Lessons learned about educating the gifted and talented: A synthesis of the research on educational practice,2007.0

"Patterns of identification and performance among gifted students identified through performance tasks: A three-year analysis gifted; alternative identification; achievement; low income; minority This study tracks the profile data of identification for gifted students in South Carolina, where a new performance-based dimension of identification has been employed, during a 3-year period. Targeted to identify more low-income and minority students, the identification protocol demonstrates efficacy in doing so. The study also tracks comparative data, showing the verbal and nonverbal profiles of students identified using this protocol in comparison to students more traditionally identified. Results suggest that students identified using performance tasks were more likely to be identified through the nonverbal assessment component of the tasks. Performance data are tracked across 2 years, showing that performance task-identified students, in general, perform at levels below traditionally identified students. In their area of strength, however, they tend to approach the mean for the traditionally identified gifted students on that portion of the high-stakes state test.",336.0,Patterns of identification and performance among gifted students identified through performance tasks: A three-year analysis,2007.0
"Effects of programmatic selectivity on the academic achievement, academic self-concepts, and aspirations of gifted college students academic achievement; academic self-concept; aspirations; postsecondary education; honors programs The purpose of this study is to examine the academic achievement, academic self-concepts, and aspirations of gifted college students who are enrolled in an honors program and of gifted college students who are not enrolled in an honors program. Participants include 294 gifted college students, 248 of whom were enrolled in an honors program and 46 who were not enrolled in an honors program. A series of analyses of covariance is used to compare the mean grade point averages, academic self-concepts, and educational aspirations of the two groups. Academic self-concept is measured using the Academic subscale of the Self Description Questionnaire III. Results indicate the gifted/honors students have higher academic achievement and higher academic self-concepts than the gifted/nonhonors students, even when controlling for SAT score. No significant differences are found with regard to aspirations. Implications are discussed.",337.0,"Effects of programmatic selectivity on the academic achievement, academic self-concepts, and aspirations of gifted college students",2007.0
"What predicts teachers' attitudes toward the gifted? attitudes; teacher training; response effect The present study explores teachers' attitudes toward the gifted and gifted education. Specifically, the authors examine whether teachers tailor their responses about attitudes toward the gifted to fit the perceived interests of the researcher. In addition, the authors examine several potential predictors of attitudes toward the gifted: training or experience in gifted education, training or experience in special education, and self-perceptions as gifted. A total of 262 teachers participate in the study. The perceived epistemic interests of the researcher do not affect teachers' self-reported attitudes toward the gifted. Teachers who had received training in gifted education hold higher perceptions of themselves as gifted. However, teachers' self-perceptions as gifted are unrelated to their attitudes toward gifted education. Finally, special education teachers hold slightly lower attitudes toward the gifted. The authors discuss the implications of these results for the field of gifted education.",338.0,What predicts teachers' attitudes toward the gifted?,2007.0
"School-within-a-school gifted programs: Perceptions of students and teachers in public secondary schools school-within-a-school gifted programs; high school gifted; secondary school gifted programming; students' perceptions; teachers' perceptions; international baccalaureate The authors conduct open-ended surveys of 530 students and teachers in three publicly funded schools with different approaches to providing a high-ability school-within-a-school: a gifted program, an international baccalaureate program, and a high-ability program with a science focus. Overall, the authors find that teachers and students in all of these gifted programs express strong satisfaction with their academic programs. At the same time, however, all groups (students and teachers in gifted and regular programs at all three schools) express concerns about the relationship between the special gifted programs and the schools within which they are housed. Based on an analysis of stakeholders' concerns and suggestions in the contexts of the different schools' approaches to integration, suggestions are made for and questions are raised about fostering a positive school climate in secondary schools that offer programming for high-ability learners.",339.0,School-within-a-school gifted programs: Perceptions of students and teachers in public secondary schools,2007.0
"A study of curriculum effectiveness in social studies social studies; gifted; critical thinking; conceptual thinking; curriculum This quasi-experimental study examines the effects on student performance of a Javits-funded curriculum designed to respond to the needs of high-ability students in elementary and middle school social studies. The curriculum, implemented with all students in heterogeneous classrooms, addresses state standards while integrating advanced content, higher level process emphases, and a conceptual orientation. Data collection focuses on student performance in conceptual reasoning, critical thinking, and content learning and on teacher demonstration of specific desired teaching behaviors. Results demonstrate significant and important differences between treatment and comparison groups in the area of content learning, favoring the treatment group; no significant differences are found for the small subsample of gifted students. Subanalyses yield differential results for specific units and schools, potentially indicating issues of treatment fidelity. Contextual challenges and implications of the study are discussed, including issues related to social studies curriculum implementation and differentiation in the current standards-based environment.",340.0,A study of curriculum effectiveness in social studies,2007.0
"Psychological types of academically gifted adolescents gifted; gifted adolescents; personality; Myers-Briggs This study provides descriptive information about the psychological types of a sample of 931 gifted adolescents who attended a public residential academy. Psychological types are assessed with the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). The MBTI reports on four pairs of personality types: Extraversion/Introversion (E/I), Sensing/Intuition (S/N), Thinking/Feeling (T/F), and Judging/Perceiving (J/P). Overall, the most common types reported by this sample were INTJ, lNTP, INFP, ENFP, and ENTP. Comparisons between gifted and norming samples are reported. Gender differences for the gifted sample were found on E/I, with males orienting toward I and females orienting toward E. Gender-specific comparisons between gifted and norming samples reveal that gifted females had a greater tendency toward I and T, and gifted males had a greater tendency for I. Overall, both genders in the gifted sample tended to be NP types.",341.0,Psychological types of academically gifted adolescents,2007.0

"Attitudes toward information technology of teachers of the gifted - Implications for gifted education attitudes; gifted education; teachers; technology This statewide study of teachers of intellectually gifted students examined teachers' attitudes toward information technology. Participants were 418 teachers of the intellectually gifted in a southeastern state who voluntarily responded to a survey about technology attitudes. Results indicated positive attitudes toward technology, with traininc, in information technology as the greatest predictor of attitude. Age of teacher, number of classroom computers, and staff development in information technology also predicted attitudes toward information technology. The relationship of these findings with previous research of attitudes of general education teachers, implications for technology training for teachers of the gifted, and suggestions for future research are discussed.",345.0,Attitudes toward information technology of teachers of the gifted - Implications for gifted education,2007.0
"The impact of an undergraduate honors program on gifted university students gifted university students; honors program community; social and emotional development Through a qualitative research design, this study examined the experiences of seven gifted university students in an undergraduate honors program. The findings indicated the students as adolescents experienced a sense of isolation resulting from the differences between their abilities, interests, life goals, religious value systems, and the communities in which they lived. At the university, the participants discovered within the honors program an intellectual and social network with other gifted individuals like them. Together they recognized their strong desire for self-actualization. In advanced-level courses, they found intellectual stimulation and academic challenge. Through several components of the honors program they developed significant psychosocial growth. Throughout their experiences, the honors program director became a mentor and played an important role in facilitating experiences designed to address the diverse needs of these gifted young adults. Implications of the findings are presented along with suggestions for designing appropriate honors program experiences for gifted university students.",346.0,The impact of an undergraduate honors program on gifted university students,2007.0
"Love and work - The legacy of early university entrance early university entrance; gifted adults; radical acceleration This is the second follow-up study of the Early Entrance Program at the University of Washington. Ninety-five individuals (45%) participated. Respondents overwhelmingly chose early university entrance because they were excited to learn; many also praised the peer group, intellectual stimulation, and faculty and staff support. Some reported feeling too young to make important academic, career, and social decisions, with more males regretting the lack of dating partners because of age differences. As the program has matured, so have students' positive experiences in it. Significant differences were found among three groups of students who entered at different points, reflecting this maturation. A wealth of open-ended comments indicated that the program continues to exert a profound and positive influence on graduates' lives.",347.0,Love and work - The legacy of early university entrance,2007.0

The present study sought to add to the knowledge base on this issue by investigating the occurrence of underachievement behaviors and their predictors in a population of highly gifted students attending a summer educational program based on the talent search model. A group of 440 students in Grades 8-10 were given the School Attitude Assessment Survey-Revised at the beginning of the program. Attitudes toward and grades obtained in students' regular schools had little to no predictive value on students' academic and behavioral performance during the summer program. Results support qualitative findings in the literature, suggesting that educational interventions can be extremely effective in reversing the expression of underachieving behaviors.",348.0,School factors and the underachievement of gifted students in a talent search summer program,2007.0

"Patterns of overexcitabilities in identified gifted students and their parents - A hierarchical model gifted students; affective needs; social and emotional development; Dabrowski's overexcitabilities The purpose of this study is to examine the underlying construct of overexcitabilities (OEs) and to identify individual- and family-level factors that may explain gifted students' patterns of OEs. Data are collected from a convenience sample of identified gifted students (N = 143) and their parents (N = 161) using a Likert-type questionnaire, the Overexcitabilities Questionnaire 11, developed to measure levels of the five intensities of the OEs. Multivariate and univariate analyses of variance and hierarchical linear modeling are used to differentiate between gender and age groups and to explain between- and within-group variance on the five subscales of the OEs: Psychomotor, Intellectual, Imaginational, Sensual, and Emotional. Results suggest that there were significant differences between gender and age groups and that most of the variance among students on the OEs was explained by family membership. This study represents an important step in our understanding of affective characteristics of giftedness and creativity.",353.0,Patterns of overexcitabilities in identified gifted students and their parents - A hierarchical model,2007.0

The contributions of these variables to self-esteem and academic achievement are also examined. Results indicate the ethnic minority groups had significantly higher El scores than their White counterparts but do not differ on OGO. El predicts self-esteem for the Hispanic students, and OGO predicts self-esteem for the African American students, but neither variable predicts selfesteem for the other two groups. El and OGO are negative and positive predictors of school achievement, respectively, but only for African American students, and neither variable predicts achievement in a summer program for academically talented youth.

"The gifted rating scales-school form - An analysis of the standardization sample based on age, gender, race, and diagnostic efficiency gifted rating scales; gifted identification; gifted screening This study analyzes the standardization sample of a new teacher rating scale designed to assist in the identification of gifted students. The Gifted Rating Scales-School Form (GRS-S) is based on a multidimensional model of giftedness. Results indicate no age or race/ethnicity differences on any of the scales and small but significant differences in favor of females on three of the six scales: Artistic Ability, Motivation, and Leadership Ability. Diagnostic efficiency statistics and receiver operating curve analysis support the validity of the Intellectual Ability scale in identifying intellectually gifted students. The Intellectual Ability scale was successful in both correctly identifying students with high IQ scores (test sensitivity) and correctly identifying students without high IQ scores (test specificity). The present findings extend the analysis of the standardization sample reported in the test manual and provide additional support for the psychometric qualities of the GRS-S as a valid gifted screening tool.",355.0,"The gifted rating scales-school form - An analysis of the standardization sample based on age, gender, race, and diagnostic efficiency",2007.0

"Investigating the influence of attribution styles on the development of mathematical talent attribution styles; self-regulation; mathematical talent; academic Olympians; vocational high school students In this article, the authors examine the influence of attribution styles on the development of mathematical talent. The study employs a Self-Confidence Attitude Attribute Scale questionnaire, which measures ability and effort attributions. Participants are three groups of highly, moderately, or mildly mathematically gifted Finnish adolescents and adults (N = 203). The results of Bayesian classification modeling show that items attributing success to effort and failure to lack of effort are the best predictors for the level of mild mathematical giftedness and gender (females). The results of multivariate analysis of variance show that highly and moderately mathematically gifted students reported that ability was more important for success than effort, but mildly mathematically. gifted tended to see effort as leading to success.
