"A Proposed Direction Forward for Gifted Education Based on Psychological Science definition and/or conception of giftedness/talent; age/developmental stage; social and/or emotional development and adjustment In this monograph, the authors advanced a set of interrelated arguments: The abilities of individuals do matter, particularly their abilities in specific talent domains; different talent domains have different developmental trajectories that vary as to when they start, peak, and end; and opportunities provided by society are crucial at every point in the talent development process. The authors argue that society must strive to promote these opportunities, but that individuals with talent also have some responsibility for their own growth and development. Furthermore, the research knowledge base indicates that psychosocial variables are determining influences in the successful development of talent. Finally, preparing young people for outstanding achievement or eminence ought to be the chief goal of gifted education.",187.0,A Proposed Direction Forward for Gifted Education Based on Psychological Science,2012.0
"Giftedness as a Developmental Construct That Leads to Eminence as Adults: Ideas and Implications From an Occupational/Career Decision-Making Perspective definition and concept of giftedness/talent; career development; vocational psychology The proposal of Subotnik, Olszewski-Kubilius, and Worrell (2011) on rethinking giftedness and gifted education has a number of implications from an occupational/career decision-making perspective. In this examination of their ideas, consideration is given to the literature in vocational psychology/career development, the emerging findings on the occupational/career decisions of gifted adolescents, and the existing research in gifted education. The new model represents a timely platform and impetus for a constructive discussion and debate on rethinking and advancing the field of gifted education.",188.0,Giftedness as a Developmental Construct That Leads to Eminence as Adults: Ideas and Implications From an Occupational/Career Decision-Making Perspective,2012.0
"Teach Students What They Don't Know but Are Ready to Learn: A Commentary on Rethinking Giftedness and Gifted Education programming/service delivery models; definition and/or conception of giftedness/talent; philosophical/theoretical We were thrilled to see an article focusing on giftedness, written by such thoughtful and well-respected researchers as Subotnik, Olszewski-Kubilius, and Worrell (2011). The expansive scope of their synthesis is so impressive that it could serve as a crash course introduction to gifted education. In our commentary, we focus specifically on the perspective of education service delivery. From this perspective, we review their guiding principles, chief goal, and provide some follow-up questions for further clarification as well as an implementation option also based on talent development.",189.0,Teach Students What They Don't Know but Are Ready to Learn: A Commentary on Rethinking Giftedness and Gifted Education,2012.0
"Psychological Science, Talent Development, and Educational Advocacy: Lost in Translation? philosophical/theoretical; definition and/or conception of giftedness/talent; advocacy The talent development approach to the conceptualization of giftedness has historical precedent in the field. Examples of large-scale and longitudinal research studies from previous decades guided by the talent development approach are provided as illustrations. The implications of focusing on domain-specific talents in academics, the arts and sport, their individual patterns of development, and the use of eminence as a goal for programs and services in gifted education are discussed. The importance of linking theoretical debates and research with the realities of policies, resource allocation, and advocacy is emphasized.",190.0,"Psychological Science, Talent Development, and Educational Advocacy: Lost in Translation?",2012.0
"Implications for Addressing the Psychosocial Needs of Gifted Individuals: A Response to Subotnik, Olszewski-Kubilius, and Worrell (2011) definition and/or conception of giftedness/talent; age/developmental stage; social and/or emotional development and adjustment In response to the article, Rethinking Giftedness and Gifted Education: A Proposed Direction Forward Based on Psychological Science, by Subotnik, Olszewski-Kubilius, and Worrell (2011), several questions arise with regard to the psychosocial needs of gifted individuals: What are the most important psychosocial variables we should take into account when cultivating talent? How do we measure these psychosocial variables? What is psychosocial coaching and how do we do it?.",191.0,"Implications for Addressing the Psychosocial Needs of Gifted Individuals: A Response to Subotnik, Olszewski-Kubilius, and Worrell (2011)",2012.0
"The Case for a Schism: A Commentary on Subotnik, Olszewski-Kubilius, and Worrell (2011) philosophical/theoretical; identification; definition and/or conception of giftedness/talent; assessment Lack of theoretical coherence in the field of gifted education has given rise to multiple attempts at a grand unification, including most recently the work of Subotnik, Olszewski-Kubilius, and Worrell (2011). The authors argue that the incoherence is an inevitable consequence of the fundamental incompatibility of theoretical and definitional features desired by psychologists and educators. Our field could best progress by splitting into the two related but distinct disciplines of high-ability psychology and advanced academics. Furthermore, the prospective adoption of Subotnik et al.'s eminence framework as an organizational principle for either advanced academics or high-ability psychology is criticized.",192.0,"The Case for a Schism: A Commentary on Subotnik, Olszewski-Kubilius, and Worrell (2011)",2012.0
"Eminence-Focused Gifted Education: Concerns About Forward Movement Void of an Equity Vision equity; definition and/or conception of giftedness/talent; gifted Black students; gifted Hispanic students; special populations/underserved gift; low income students; assessment; identification; majority-minority public schools This article is based on Grantham's commentary on an eminence-focused gifted education model developed by Subotnik, Olszewski-Kubilius, and Worrell. Grantham primarily reviews the model from an equity perspective, taking into account the changing demographics in the nation's public schools. Specifically, Grantham asserts that education leaders want and need forward-thinking models that address race and class issues because public school populations are increasingly browner and poorer, unlike many gifted program enrollments that tend to represent students from White and middle-class backgrounds. Underrepresentation in gifted programs among minorities (particularly Blacks and Hispanics) and low-income students plagues our field and turns off many public school advocates to gifted education. Education leaders may embrace new models when they squarely address the reality that circa 2020, public schools will be majority minority. Researchers stand a better chance of gaining traction to move the field forward when their model shows promise for involving greater numbers of students representing our pluralistic society. To rethink giftedness and gifted education, Subotnik, Olszewski-Kubilius, and Worrell rely on works from psychology; however, important past and present perspectives from psychologists who have researched underrepresented groups and equity issues are excluded. Education leaders may recognize this omission and view the eminence-focused approach (and perhaps its underlying paradigm) as a less novel model and more of a perpetuation of the same status quo in gifted education. In sum, Grantham's commentary encourages scholars not to depart from a legacy of addressing excellence and equity through new models that move the field forward.",193.0,Eminence-Focused Gifted Education: Concerns About Forward Movement Void of an Equity Vision,2012.0
"Positively Influencing Gifted Education Policy policy; advocacy; definition and/or conception of giftedness/talent; programming/service delivery models; social and/or emotional; development and adjustment The approach proposed by Subotnik, Olszewski-Kubilius, and Worrell (2011) has significant implications for the field of gifted education, many of which would increase advocates' ability to achieve success when working with policy makers. This commentary explores those implications and examines how the proposed approach can be integrated within the field from a policy perspective.",194.0,Positively Influencing Gifted Education Policy,2012.0
"Important Issues, Some Rhetoric, and a Few Straw Men: A Response to Comments on Rethinking Giftedness and Gifted Education philosophical/theoretical; definition and/or conception of giftedness/talent; special populations/underserved gifted In this article, the authors respond to the eight commentaries on Rethinking Giftedness and Gifted Education: A Proposed Direction Forward Based on Psychological Science using several themes to organize their response. These themes include ability, developmental trajectories, effort and opportunity, psychosocial factors, eminence, and equity. The authors reaffirm the contention that eminence is an appropriate standard for assigning the gifted label in individuals with well-developed talents.",195.0,"Important Issues, Some Rhetoric, and a Few Straw Men: A Response to Comments on Rethinking Giftedness and Gifted Education",2012.0
"Giftedness and Gifted Education: The Need for a Paradigm Change identification; definition and/or conception of giftedness/talent; assessment; evaluation; professional development This commentary addresses Subotnik et al.'s target article from the perspective of researchers active in the field of giftedness. First, we self-critically examine the current standing of giftedness research within the scientific community. Second, the authors' critique of gifted education is sharpened in three respects: (a) gifted identification, (b) effectiveness of gifted education, and (c) credentials of gifted education. Finally, four necessary and productive lines for future research are proposed.",196.0,Giftedness and Gifted Education: The Need for a Paradigm Change,2012.0
"Twice-Exceptional Students Enrolled in Advanced Placement Classes Advanced Placement; high school; special populations/underserved gifted; twice-exceptional Twice-exceptional students, those who have disabilities and display areas of gifts or talents, frequently spend their high school years with a focus on their disabilities. Using semistructured interviews, this study explores the perceptions of parents, teachers, and guidance counselors regarding participation of twice-exceptional students in Advanced Placement (AP) and for-college-credit classes. The supports and barriers for students with disabilities participating in AP and for-college-credit classes were identified. Additionally, participants included six college students who had taken AP and/or for-college-credit classes while still in high school. The results of this study indicated that school culture and early placement decisions affect enrollment in AP and for-college-credit classes for the twice-exceptional student. Inconsistencies between students' goals and transition planning and inconsistent implementation of test and environmental accommodations were documented.",197.0,Twice-Exceptional Students Enrolled in Advanced Placement Classes,2012.0
"Statistical Methods Used in Gifted Education Journals, 2006-2010 statistical analyses; methodology; reliability; quantitative methods; literature review This article describes the statistical methods used in quantitative and mixed methods articles between 2006 and 2010 in five gifted education research journals. Results indicate that the most commonly used statistical methods are means (85.9% of articles), standard deviations (77.8%), Pearson's r (47.8%), chi(2) (32.2%), ANOVA (30.7%), t tests (30.0%), and MANOVA (23.0%). Approximately half (53.3%) of the articles included reliability reports for the data at hand; Cronbach's alpha was the most commonly reported measure of reliability (41.5%).

"The Effects of Peer Coaching on the Evaluation Knowledge, Skills, and Concerns of Gifted Program Administrators evaluation; identification; professional development; programming/service delivery models; special populations/underserved gifted To increase knowledge and skills in program evaluation, a peer-coaching intervention provided one-on-one professional development to gifted program administrators. This randomized field study examined the effects of peer coaching on evaluation knowledge and skills and on administrators' concerns about implementing more rigorous program evaluations. In addition, the peer-coaching intervention focused on increased access to program services for culturally diverse and low-income gifted learners. Results revealed a statistically significant increase in gifted administrators' knowledge of and skills in program evaluation attributed to the peer-coaching intervention. Peer-coached program administrators were less distracted and more focused on implementing program evaluation and reported decreased concerns about implementing them. Peer coaching did not increase placements for culturally diverse and low-income learners in program services; however, peer coaching positively affected referral rate for traditionally underrepresented groups.",199.0,"The Effects of Peer Coaching on the Evaluation Knowledge, Skills, and Concerns of Gifted Program Administrators",2012.0
"Reexamining the Role of Gifted Education and Talent Development for the 21st Century: A Four-Part Theoretical Approach gifted education; Enrichment Triad Model; Operation Houndstooth; talent development; Three Ring Conception of Giftedness Why and how should a society devote special resources to the development of giftedness in young people for the twenty-first century? If we agree that the goals of gifted education and talent development are to maximize young people's opportunities for self-fulfillment and increase society's reservoir of creative problem solvers and producers of knowledge, then it would seem wise that programming and services enhance students' capacity for creative productivity, not just content acquisition. This general theory for the development of human potential is discussed through an exploration of four research-based subtheories: the Three-Ring Conception of Giftedness, the Enrichment Triad Model, Operation Houndstooth, and Executive Functions. In this article, a reexamination of current gifted and talented programming is intended to generate future research, extend dialogue among scholars, and inspire continued support for programming based on theory and related research.",200.0,Reexamining the Role of Gifted Education and Talent Development for the 21st Century: A Four-Part Theoretical Approach,2012.0
"How Are Schools in England Addressing the Needs of Mathematically Gifted Children in Primary Classrooms? A Review of Practice giftedness; mathematics; provision; teaching; ability grouping There is a paucity of research investigating aspects of provision for gifted children within primary schools, particularly in mathematics. This study aimed to address this topic by illuminating issues arising from classroom practice and the experience of both teachers and children. Based on in-depth case studies in four primary schools in which different methods of provision were being implemented, this study found that although there is an interest in addressing the needs of mathematically gifted children and schools have taken measures in pragmatic terms to cater to them, the needs of these children are not always addressed in classrooms. Evidence from classroom practice showed that the effectiveness of any method depends on teachers' expertise and self-confidence, the level of focused attention given to gifted children, the size of the class, and the nature of the work set. Additionally, this study identified issues relating to organizational strategies of classroom provision which need consideration and further research.",201.0,How Are Schools in England Addressing the Needs of Mathematically Gifted Children in Primary Classrooms?

"Cognitive and Academic Distinctions Between Gifted Students With Autism and Asperger Syndrome autism spectrum disorders; cognitive profiles; academic profiles; gifted students The cognitive and academic profiles of high ability students with autism spectrum disorder were examined. Inclusion criteria were a diagnosis of autism (high functioning) or Asperger syndrome and at least one ability and/or achievement index standard score of 120 or above. Results indicated that despite the restricted range of cognitive abilities, students diagnosed with Asperger syndrome had significantly higher Verbal Comprehension Index scores than did students diagnosed with autism. However, students with autism had significantly higher scores on tests of math fluency and written expression than did students with Asperger syndrome. Implications for assessment, diagnosis, and intervention are discussed.",202.0,Cognitive and Academic Distinctions Between Gifted Students With Autism and Asperger Syndrome,2012.0
"Regression Discontinuity Design in Gifted and Talented Education Research regression discontinuity; gifted education; causal inference; permissive assignment; misallocation of treatment This Methodological Brief introduces the reader to the regression discontinuity design (RDD), which is a method that when used correctly can yield estimates of research treatment effects that are equivalent to those obtained through randomized control trials and can therefore be used to infer causality. However, RDD does not require the random assignment of individuals to treatment and control groups, making it very attractive for applied researchers in educational settings. This Brief introduces the method, discusses applications and limitations, and illustrates an idealized example as well as some potential pitfalls and their relevance to the context of gifted education research.",203.0,Regression Discontinuity Design in Gifted and Talented Education Research,2012.0
"Academically Gifted Students' Perceived Interpersonal Competence and Peer Relationships multivariate analyses; peer relationships; secondary; social and/or emotional development and adjustment Perceptions of the interpersonal competence and peer relationships of 1,526 gifted adolescents who had previously participated in academic gifted programs at the Center for Talent Development were examined, using an online survey. Major findings included that the gifted students had generally positive perceptions of their abilities to initiate, form, and maintain relationships with other people, including same-age nongifted peers, and demonstrated levels of interpersonal ability and peer relationships, comparable to that of grade equivalent students in the norming group. The students did not perceive their giftedness as a negative factor affecting their peer relationships but rated their academic self-concept more positively than their social self-concept. Differences were found by gender and experience with subject acceleration in school, favoring female students over male students and favoring students who were accelerated in a subject in school over students who were not. The results also suggested that gifted students whose academic strength was in the verbal area over other areas were more likely to face difficulties with peer relationships.",204.0,Academically Gifted Students' Perceived Interpersonal Competence and Peer Relationships,2012.0
"The Forced Choice Dilemma: A Model Incorporating Idiocentric/Allocentric Cultural Orientation gifted education; forced choice dilemma; cultural orientation; idiocentrism; allocentrism; Australia This study developed and tested a new model of the forced choice dilemma (i.e., the belief held by some intellectually gifted students that they must choose between academic achievement and peer acceptance) that incorporates individual-level cultural orientation variables (i.e., vertical allocentrism and vertical idiocentrism). A survey that had previously been administered to a sample of intellectually gifted Australian adolescents was modified and then administered to a new sample of 450 intellectually gifted Australian students enrolled in Grades 7 through 12. The data were analyzed using structural equation modeling procedures. The major findings of the study were that: (a) motivation for academic success and need for peer acceptance generally predict the experience of the forced choice dilemma, and (b) vertical allocentric and vertical idiocentric orientations strongly predict motivation for academic success. The findings of the study provide insights that may assist educators, psychologists, counselors, and family members to better understand, and guide, intellectually gifted students affected by the forced choice dilemma. Putting the Research to Use Educators, psychologists, counselors, and families may be able to use the model developed and confirmed in this study to better understand how some intellectually gifted students experience the dilemma arising from a perceived conflict between academic achievement and peer acceptance. The model provides insights on how specific cultural orientations of students may play a part in how the dilemma is experienced. It appears that intellectually gifted students who value human inequality and interdependence are more able to resolve the dilemma; hence, attention in this realm should be focused on those students who place greater importance on human equality and/or independence, for whom the dilemma may be a more difficult issue.",205.0,The Forced Choice Dilemma: A Model Incorporating Idiocentric/Allocentric Cultural Orientation,2012.0
"Examining the Effects of Gifted Programming in Mathematics and Reading Using the ECLS-K gifted education; elementary schools; achievement; attitude; hierarchical linear modeling; propensity score analysis This study examined the average effects of schools' third through fifth grade gifted programming policy in mathematics and reading on overall school achievement, on gifted students' achievement and academic attitudes and on nongifted students' achievement and academic attitudes. Data and results represent a broad, national look at school personnel-reported programming without distinction as to type, length, or degree of programming. No detrimental effects were found at the overall school level or for nongifted students. However, the results also indicated that, on average, the diverse programs reported in the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1988-1989 (ECLS-K) database had no effect on gifted students' achievement or academic attitudes. Considered in light of prior research indicating benefits of specific programs and existing inconsistent policies and programs, this suggests the need for future research to determine effective program characteristics and suggests that policy makers, educators, and parents actively must seek research-based practices to use with gifted children.",206.0,Examining the Effects of Gifted Programming in Mathematics and Reading Using the ECLS-K,2012.0

"Examining Relationships and Effects in Gifted Education Research: An Introduction to Structural Equation Modeling structural equation modeling; confirmatory factor analysis; latent constructs; measurement error The aim of this Methodological Brief to structural equation modeling (SEM) is to help readers become more aware of its uses and how to understand research using it. SEM provides many benefits over traditional multiple regression, including the ability to model multiple outcomes simultaneously and to account for measurement error. This Brief provides a general overview of the purposes of SEM and reviews how SEM can estimate models with both observed variables as well as their underlying constructs and how the adequacy of models is assessed in SEM. Finally, this Brief introduces path diagrams and latent variable models with an illustration of how to understand diagrams and standardized estimates.",209.0,Examining Relationships and Effects in Gifted Education Research: An Introduction to Structural Equation Modeling,2012.0
"Gifted Girls and Nonmathematical Aspirations: A Longitudinal Case Study of Two Gifted Korean Girls career aspirations; early identification; enculturation; gender inequalities; gifted education; Korea; mathematics; self-concept In this longitudinal study of two gifted Korean girls, experiences with early admittance into a gifted program are charted alongside their family and societal experiences that ultimately influenced their career choices in nonmathematical fields. The 8-year-long qualitative study involved extensive interviews with the two gifted girls and their parents to determine factors that led to their choice of a nonmathematical area of specialization in spite of early identification and support of their mathematical talent. Using tenets of qualitative inquiry to code the longitudinal data, the authors identified three main factors that contributed to these career choices, which are presented in the form of narratives. One of the startling findings of this study, contrary to the literature in gifted education research, is that the two girls' early experiences with gifted education kept them from choosing careers related to mathematics. The article also narrates the enculturation of mathematically gifted girls in Korea that leads to nonmathematical career aspirations.",210.0,Gifted Girls and Nonmathematical Aspirations: A Longitudinal Case Study of Two Gifted Korean Girls,2012.0
